Different strains of cannabis vary radically in their cannabinoid composition and in the contaminants\u00a0-- fungi, bacteria, pesticides, heavy metals and other substances\u00a0-- they contain.

Other plant-derived drugs\u00a0-- morphine, codeine and Taxol, to name a few\u00a0-- have made it through the F.D.A.'s review process, and there is no reason drugs made from cannabis should not be required to meet the same standards.\""]},

And I believe that we are at a state where, of course, we are very concerned about people who are suffering pain, and there are various means of providing pain management. And those that have had loved ones that have gone through an end of life with cancer know the nature of real pain. I watched my wife's mom and dad, both in our home, both going through cancer treatment, suffering a great deal of pain. But they didn't have marijuana, and they didn't need marijuana because there were other sources of pain management that worked entirely effectively. I'm told there is even a synthetic marijuana as well that is available. But having legalized marijuana, in my view, is an effort by a very committed few to try and get marijuana out into the public and ultimately legalize marijuana. It's a long way to go. We need less drugs in this society, not more drugs, and I would oppose the legalization of marijuana in the country or legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes because pain management is available from other sources.\""]},
