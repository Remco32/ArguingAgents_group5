 The decrease in drunk driving fatalities as a percentage of total traffic fatalities in the United States does not correlate to the MLDA.
  Since 1982, two years prior to the Uniform Drinking Age Act establishing an MLDA of 21, a decline of drunk driving fatalities occurred across all age groups and demographic categories, and therefore cannot be reliably attributed to MLDA 21.
