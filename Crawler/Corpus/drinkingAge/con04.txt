 MLDA 21 reduces alcohol consumption and the number of underage drinkers.
  87% of studies, according to a meta study on MLDA, found higher legal drinking ages associated with lower alcohol consumption.  Studies indicate that when the drinking age is 21, those younger than 21 drink less and continue to drink less through their early 20s, and that youth who do not drink until they are 21 tend to drink less as adults.  The number of 18-to-20 year-olds who report drinking alcohol in the past month has decreased from 59% in 1985 – one year after Congress passed the  – to 39% in 2016.
