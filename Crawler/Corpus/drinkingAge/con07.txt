 The American public overwhelmingly supports MLDA 21.
  A survey for the Center for Alcohol Policy found that 86% of Americans support the legal drinking age being set at 21.  Numerous state and national surveys dating from the 1970s (when states were raising the legal drinking age) through the present have shown overwhelming public support for MLDA 21.
