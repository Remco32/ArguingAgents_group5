 There are fewer drunk driving traffic accidents and fatalities in many countries with MLDA of 18.
  In the United States, 31% of road traffic deaths involve alcohol.  This percentage is higher than many countries with a drinking age lower than 21 such as France (29%), Great Britain (16%), Germany (9%), China (4%), and Israel (3%).  Although the United States increased the MLDA to 21 in 1984, its rate of traffic accidents and fatalities in the 1980s decreased less than that of European countries whose legal drinking ages are lower than 21.
