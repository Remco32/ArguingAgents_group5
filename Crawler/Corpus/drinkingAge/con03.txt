 MLDA 21 reduces traffic accidents and fatalities.
  100 of the 102 analyses (98%) in a meta-study of the legal drinking age and traffic accidents found higher legal drinking ages associated with lower rates of traffic accidents.  In the 30 years since MLDA 21 was introduced, drunk driving fatalities decreased by a third.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that MLDA 21 has saved 31,417 lives from 1975-2016.
