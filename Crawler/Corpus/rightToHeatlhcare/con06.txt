 A right to health care could lead to government rationing of medical services. 
 Countries with universal health care, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand,  and the United Kingdom,  all ration health care using methods such as controlled distribution, budgeting, price setting, and service restrictions.  In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) rations health care using a cost-benefit analysis. For example, in 2008 any drug that provided an extra six months of "good-quality" life for £10,000 ($15,150) or less was automatically approved, while one that costs more might not be.  In order to expand health coverage to more Americans, Obamacare created an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make cost-benefit analyses to keep Medicare spending from growing too fast. According to Sally Pipes, President of the Pacific Research Institute, the IPAB "is essentially charged with rationing care."  According to a 2009 Wall Street Journal editorial, "once health care is nationalized, or mostly nationalized, medical rationing is inevitable."
