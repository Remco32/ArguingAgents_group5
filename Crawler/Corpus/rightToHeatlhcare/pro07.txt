 Because the United States is a very wealthy country, it should provide health care for all its citizens. 
 Many European countries with a universal right to health care, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, have a lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita than the United States,  yet they provide a right to health care for all their citizens. As of 2012, 47.9 million people (15.4% of the US population) did not have health insurance  and, according to a June 2013 study, even with the Obamacare reforms as many as 31 million people will still be uninsured in 2016.  The United States spent $8,508 per person on health care in 2011, over 2.5 times the average spent by member countries of the OECD ($3,322 per person).  With that level of spending, the United States should be able to provide a right to healthcare to everyone.
