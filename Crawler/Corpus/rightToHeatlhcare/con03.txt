 Implementing a right to health care could lead the United States towards socialism. 
 Socialism, by definition, entails government control of the distribution of goods and services.  Under a single-payer system where everyone has a right to health care, and all health care bills are paid by the government, the government can control the distribution of health care services. According to Ronald Reagan, "one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine," and once socialized medicine is instituted, "behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom."  In Aug. 2013, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) was asked if Obamacare is a step towards a single-payer universal health care system, he answered "absolutely, yes."  The free market should determine the availability and cost of health care services, not the federal government.
