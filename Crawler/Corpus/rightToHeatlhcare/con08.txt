 A right to health care could lower doctors' earnings. 
 The Medicare system in the United States is a single-payer system where government pays for health care bills, and between 1998 and 2009 it reduced physician payments in three different years. In 2009, Medicare payments to health care providers were almost 20% below those paid out by private insurance.  In Britain and Canada, where there is a universal right to health care, physicians have incomes 30% lower than US doctors.  According to a 2011 study, in comparison to US specialists, the average specialist in Canada earned 30% less, and the average specialist in the United Kingdom earned 50% less.  Any lowering of doctor payments in the United States could reduce the number of young people entering the medical profession, leading to a doctor shortage.
