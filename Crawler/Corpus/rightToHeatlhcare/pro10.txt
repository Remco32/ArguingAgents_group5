 A right to health care could stop medical bankruptcies. 
 About 62% of all US bankruptcies were related to medical expenses in 2007,  and 78% of these bankruptcies were filed by people who already had medical insurance.  In 2010, there were 30 million Americans who were contacted by a collection agency about a medical bill.  If all US citizens were provided health care under a single-payer system medical bankruptcy would no longer exist, because the government, not private citizens, would pay all medical bills.
