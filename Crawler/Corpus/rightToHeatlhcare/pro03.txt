 The right to health care is an internationally recognized human right. 
 On Dec. 10, 1948 the United States and 47 other nations signed the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The document stated that "everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one's family, including... medical care."  In 2005 the United States and the other member states of the World Health Organization signed World Health Assembly resolution 58.33, which stated that everyone should have access to health care services and should not suffer financial hardship when obtaining these services.  According to a 2008 peer-reviewed study in the , "[r]ight-to-health features are not just good management, justice, or humanitarianism, they are obligations under human-rights law."  The United States and Mexico are the only countries of the 34 members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that do not have universal health care.  As of 2013 over half of the world's countries had a right to health care in their national constitutions.
