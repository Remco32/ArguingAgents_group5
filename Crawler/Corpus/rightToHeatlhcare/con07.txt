 A right to health care could lower the quality and availability of disease screening and treatment. 
 In countries with a universal right to health care certain disease treatment outcomes are worse than the United States. The US 5-year survival rate for all cancers is 64.6%, compared to 51.6% in Europe.  The United States also has a higher 5-year survival rate than Canada.  Studies have found that US cancer screening rates are higher than those in Canada  and 10 European countries with universal health care including France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.  The United States is estimated to have the highest prostate and breast cancer survival rates in the world.  The United States also has high survival rates after a stroke, with an age-adjusted 30-day fatality rate of 3 per 100, lower than the OECD average of 5.2 per 100. In addition, the 30-day survival rate after a heart attack is higher in the United States than the OECD average.
