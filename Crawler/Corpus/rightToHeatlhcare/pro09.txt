 A right to health care could encourage entrepreneurship. 
 Many people are afraid to start their own businesses for fear of losing the health insurance provided at their existing jobs. The Kauffman-RAND Institute for Entrepreneurship Public Policy estimated that a 33% increase in new US businesses may result from the increased access to health insurance through the Obamacare health insurance exchanges.  A 2001 study found that providing universal health care in the United States could increase self-employment by 2 to 3.5 percent.
