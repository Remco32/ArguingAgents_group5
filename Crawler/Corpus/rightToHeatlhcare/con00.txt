 The founding documents of the United States do not provide support for a right to health care. 
 Nowhere in the Declaration of Independence does it say there is a right to health care.  The purpose of the US Constitution, as stated in the Preamble, is to "promote the general welfare," not to provide it. The Bill of Rights lists a number of personal freedoms that the government cannot infringe upon, not material goods or services that the government must provide.  According to former Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX), "you have a right to your life and you have a right to your liberty and you have a right to keep what you earn in a free country... You do not have the right to services or things."
