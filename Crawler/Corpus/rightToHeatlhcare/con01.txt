 A right to health care could increase the US debt and deficit. 
 Spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, all government programs that provide a right to health care for certain segments of the population, totaled less than 10% of the federal budget in 1985, but by 2012 these programs took up 21% of the federal budget.  According to US House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI), government health care programs are "driving the explosive growth in our spending and our debt."  Studies have concluded that the expansion of insurance coverage under Obamacare will increase the federal deficit by $340-$700 billion in the first 10 years,  and could increase the deficit to $1.5 trillion in the second 10 years.  Even with these expenditures, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates Obamacare will leave 30 million people without health insurance.  If everyone in the US were covered under a universal right to health care, the increase in the federal deficit could be even larger than under Obamacare.
