 Standardized tests are unfair and discriminatory against non English speakers and students with special needs.
   English language learners take tests in English before they have mastered the language.  Special education students take the same tests as other children, receiving few of the accommodations usually provided to them as part of their Individualized Education Plans (IEP).
