 Testing is not too stressful for students.
  The US Department of Education stated: "Although testing may be stressful for some students, testing is a normal and expected way of assessing what students have learned."  A Nov. 2001 University of Arkansas study found that "the vast majority of students do not exhibit stress and have positive attitudes towards standardized testing programs."  Young students vomit at their desks for a variety of reasons, but only in rare cases is this the result of testing anxiety.
