 Increased testing does not force teachers to encourage "drill n' kill" rote learning.
  According to a study in the Oct. 28, 2005, issue of the peer-reviewed , good teachers understand that "isolated drills on the types of items expected on the test" are unacceptable, and principals interviewed said "they would sanction any teacher caught teaching to the test."  In any case, research has shown that drilling students does not produce test score gains: "teaching a curriculum aligned to state standards and using test data as feedback produces higher test scores than an instructional emphasis on memorization and test-taking skills."
