 China has a long tradition of standardized testing and leads the world in educational achievement.
  China displaced Finland as number one in reading, math, and science when Shanghai debuted on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings in 2009.  Despite calls for a reduction in standardized testing, China's testing regimen remains firmly in place.  Chester E. Finn, Jr., Chairman of the Hoover Institution's Koret Task Force on K–12 Education, predicts that Chinese cities will top the PISA charts for the next several decades.
