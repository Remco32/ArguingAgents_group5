 Cheating by teachers and administrators on standardized tests is rare, and not a reason to stop testing America's children.
  The Mar. 2011 investigation of scoring anomalies in six states and Washington DC was inconclusive, and found compelling suggestions of impropriety in only one school.  The US Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said on Jan. 7, 2013 that an investigation had found no evidence of widespread cheating on the DC Comprehensive Assessment System tests.  It is likely that some cheating occurs, but some people cheat on their tax returns also, and the solution is not to abolish taxation.
