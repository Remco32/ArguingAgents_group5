 School uniforms can save parents money.
  Parents can reduce their financial burden when their children are limited to wearing one simple outfit every day.  A study of uniform cost in the United Kingdom found that uniforms cost parents £88.05 ($128.79) per outfit, while out-of-school outfits averaged £113.00 ($165.79).  A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe "one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel," and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less.  Uniform company French Toast states on their website that the average cost one of their complete school uniforms is $45 and that most children will only require two sets.  Without school uniform policies, parents may feel pressure to compete with other families by purchasing fashionable clothes for their children.
