 Parents should be free to choose their children's clothes without government interference.
  One of the founders of the Wilson County (LA) Parents Coalition, Richard Dashkovitz, stated: "It's time we let the government know that we are fed up with this. Quit dictating to us what my child should wear... [T]he government is intruding into our private lives, roles as parents and the lives of our children."  According to another parents' rights group, Asserting Parental Rights â€” It's Our Duty, mandatory uniform "policies trample parents' right to raise children without government interference."
