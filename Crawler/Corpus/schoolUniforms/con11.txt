 School uniforms in public schools undermine the promise of a free education by imposing an extra expense on families.
  Parents already pay taxes, and they still need to buy regular clothes for their children to wear when they're out of school and for dress-down days. The Children's Commission on Poverty (UK) found that over "95% of parents on low incomes reported difficulties in meeting school-related costs," including uniforms, despite their children attending tuition-free schools.  Anderson, IN, parents Laura and Scott Bell their children's school over its uniform policy, saying the $641 for their children's uniforms broke the guarantee of a free public education.  In York County, PA, a local NBC affiliate reported that some children were missing class because their families couldn't afford to purchase the required uniforms.
