 The push for school uniforms is driven by commercial interests rather than educational ones.
  Americans spend around $1 billion on school uniforms every year.   Retailer J.C. Penney Co. says school uniforms are "a huge, important business for us."  In one year alone, uniform company Lands' End spent $3 million on marketing efforts directed at public schools and districts.  Multiple studies used to promote the effectiveness of uniforms were partly funded by Lands' End, and at least one of those studies is "so wholly flawed as to render itself useless," according to David L. Brunsma, PhD.   Reuters reported that retailers were "sensing their opportunity... stepping up competition in the uniform aisles and online. Walmart has set up 'uniform shops' or temporary boutiques within some stores."
