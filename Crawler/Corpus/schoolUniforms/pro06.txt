 School uniforms prevent the display of gang colors and insignia. 
 The US Department of  stated that uniform policies can "prevent gang members from wearing gang colors and insignia at school" in order to "encourage a safe environment."  According to a 2017 National Center for Education Statistics report, in 2015, 11% of students age 12-18 said there were gang members at their schools, down from 20% in 2001.  Educators in the Long Beach Unified School District have speculated that the sharp reduction in crime following the introduction of school uniforms was a result of gang conflicts being curbed.  Osceola County, FL School Board member Jay Wheeler reported that the county's schools had a 46% drop in gang activity after their first full school year with a mandatory K-12 uniform policy. Wheeler stated that "clothing is integral to gang culture... Imagine a U.S. Armed Forces recruiter out of uniform trying to recruit new soldiers; the success rate goes down. The same applies to gang recruitment."
