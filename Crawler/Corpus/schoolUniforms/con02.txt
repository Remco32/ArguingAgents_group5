 School uniforms do not stop bullying and may increase violent attacks.
  Tony Volk, PhD, Associate Professor at Brock University, stated, "Overall, there is no evidence in bullying literature that supports a reduction in violence due to school uniforms." A peer-reviewed study found that "school uniforms increased the average number of assaults by about 14 [per year] in the most violent schools."  A Texas Southern University study found that school discipline incidents rose by about 12% after the introduction of uniforms.  According to the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Education Evaluation and Management, fights in middle schools nearly doubled within one year of introducing mandatory uniforms.
