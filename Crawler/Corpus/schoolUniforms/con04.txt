 The key findings used to tout the benefits of uniforms are questionable.
  The oft-quoted improvements to school safety and student behavior in the Long Beach (CA) Unified School District from 1993-1995 may not have resulted from the introduction of school uniforms. The study in which the findings were published cautioned that "it is not clear that these results are entirely attributable to the uniform policy" and suggests that the introduction of new school security measures made at the same time may have been partly responsible.  Other reform efforts implemented alongside the uniform policy included a $1 million project to develop alternative teaching strategies.
