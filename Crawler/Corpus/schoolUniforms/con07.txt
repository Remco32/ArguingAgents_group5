 Uniforms may have a detrimental effect on students' self-image.
  When students have to wear the same outfits, rather than being allowed to select clothes that suit their body types, they can suffer embarrassment at school. Child and teen development specialist Robyn Silverman told NBC News' Today that students, especially girls, tend to compare how each other looks in their uniforms: "As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it allows for a lot of comparison... So if you have a body thatâ€™s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best."  A study by researchers at Arizona State University found that "students from schools without uniforms reported higher self-perception scores than students from schools with uniform policies."  Some students also find uniforms less comfortable than their regular clothes, which may not be conducive to learning.
