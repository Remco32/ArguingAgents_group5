  The chickenpox is often just a rash with blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and calamine lotion.  The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids.  Rubella is often just a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.  Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.
