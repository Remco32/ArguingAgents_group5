 Diseases that vaccines target have essentially disappeared.
  There is no reason to vaccinate against diseases that no longer occur in the United States. The CDC reported no cases or deaths from diphtheria between 2003 and 2011 in the United States.  Fewer than 51 cases and 10 deaths per year from tetanus were reported between 1994 and 2011.  Polio has been declared eradicated in the United States since 1979.  There have been fewer than 21 deaths yearly from rubella since 1971 and fewer than 25 deaths yearly from mumps since 1968.
