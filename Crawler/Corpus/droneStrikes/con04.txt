 Drone strikes violate international law. 
 Under international humanitarian law, the targeted individual must be directly participating in hostilities with the United States.  Under international human rights law, the targeted individual must pose an imminent threat that only lethal force can prevent.  Simply being suspected of some connection to a "militant" organization — or, under the CIA's policy of "signature" drone strikes, fitting the profile of a terrorist in an area where terrorists are known to operate – is not legally sufficient to make someone a permissible target for killing.  Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations, states that "no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life," even in times of armed conflict.  Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by one state against another,  with the exceptions of (1) the consent of the host state,  and (2) when the use of force is in self-defense in response to an armed attack or an imminent threat, where the host state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate action.  Members of militant groups with which the United States is not in an armed conflict are therefore not lawful targets.  Amnesty International says drone strikes can be classified as "war crimes" or illegal "extrajudicial executions."
