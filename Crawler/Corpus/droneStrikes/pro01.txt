 Drones kill fewer civilians, as a percentage of total fatalities, than any other military weapon. 
 The traditional weapons of war - bombs, shells, mines, mortars - cause more unintended ("collateral") damage to people and property than drones, whose accuracy and technical precision mostly limit casualties to combatants and intended targets.  Although estimates vary because of the secretive nature of the program, it is estimated that 174 to 1,047 civilians have been killed in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia since the United States began conducting drone strikes abroad following the Sep. 11, 2001 attacks, roughly 8-17% of all deaths from US drones.      In comparison, in World War II, civilian deaths, as a percentage of total war fatalities, are estimated at 40 to 67%.   In the Korean,  Vietnam,  and Balkan Wars,  the percentages are approximately 70%, 31%, and 45% respectively.
