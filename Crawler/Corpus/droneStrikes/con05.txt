 Drone strikes are secretive, lack sufficient legal oversight, and prevent citizens from holding their leaders accountable. 
 Drones are used in conflicts where war is not openly declared and authorized by Congress, allowing the executive branch to have nearly unlimited power over secret wars across the world. Strikes by the CIA (responsible for approximately 80% of all US drone strikes worldwide) are classified under US law as Title 50 covert actions, defined as "activities of the United States Government... where it is intended that the role... will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly."  As covert operations, the government cannot legally provide any information about how the CIA conducts targeted killings.  The CIA has yet to officially acknowledge its drone programs anywhere in the world,  let alone describe the rules and procedures for compliance with US and international law.  The administration only gives drone program details to members of Congress whom it deems "appropriate,"  and it has sought to prevent judicial review of claims brought in US courts by human rights groups seeking accountability for potentially unlawful killings.
