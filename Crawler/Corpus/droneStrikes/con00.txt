 Drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill. 
 People who see their loved ones injured or killed in drone attacks become motivated to join actions against the United States. According to author Jeremy Scahill, the vast majority of militants operating in Yemen today are "people who are aggrieved by attacks on their homes that forced them to go out and fight."  Support for al Qaeda in Yemen is "indigenously spreading and merging with the mounting rage of powerful tribes at US counterterrorism policy" as the drone strikes have "recruited thousands."  The number of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) core members grew from 300 in 2009 (when US drone strikes resumed after a seven-year hiatus) to 700 in 2012, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of terrorist attacks in the region.  Both the "Underwear Bomber," who tried to blow up an American airliner in 2009,  and the "Times Square Bomber," who tried to set off a car bomb in New York City in 2010,  cited drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia as motivators for the plots.
