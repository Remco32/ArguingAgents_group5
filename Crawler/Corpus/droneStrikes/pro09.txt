 The United States cannot risk falling behind the rest of the world in the development of drone technologies. 
 More than 87 countries own some type of surveillance or attack drone, changing the way nations conduct war and threatening to begin a new arms race as governments scramble to counterbalance their adversaries.  In 2010 Iran unveiled what it claimed was its first armed drone,  and China unveiled 25 drone models.  In 2011 there were 680 active drone development programs run by governments, companies, and research institutes around the world, compared with 195 in 2005.   The Teal Group, a defense-consulting firm, estimated in June 2013 that the global market for the research, development, and procurement of armed drones would nearly double over the next decade from $5.2 billion annually to $11.6 billion.  Insurgent groups are also moving to acquire this technology; in 2011, Libyan opposition forces bought a drone during their attempt to overthrow dictator Moammar Gadhafi  and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah claimed in 2012 that it flew an Iranian-made drone over Israel.
