 Drone strikes violate the sovereignty of other countries. 
 Strikes are often carried out without the permission and against the objection of the target countries. Pakistan's foreign ministry on June 4, 2012 called drone strikes "illegal" and said they violated the country’s sovereignty.  On Oct. 22, 2013, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that the "use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country... I would therefore stress the need for an end to drone attacks."  The United Nations' Human Rights Chief,  Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights,  and Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions  have all called US drone strikes a violation of sovereignty, and have pressed for investigations into the legality of the attacks. In a July 18, 2013, 39-country survey by Pew Research, only six countries approved of US drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.
