 Drone strikes are cheaper than engaging in ground or manned aerial combat. 
 With approximately $5 billion allocated for drones in the 2012 Department of Defense budget,  America's entire drone program constitutes only about 1% of the entire annual military budget.  In comparison, the military's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program alone cost the United States $9.7 billion in fiscal year 2012.  US manned military attack aircraft cost anywhere from $18,000 to $169,000 per hour to operate - six to 42 times more than attack drones.  Al Qaeda spent roughly half a million dollars to plan and execute the attacks on the United States on Sep. 11, 2001.  In response, the United States spent roughly $2.2 trillion on funding manned air and ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and on homeland security costs in the following decade - over $4 million for every dollar al Qaeda spent.
