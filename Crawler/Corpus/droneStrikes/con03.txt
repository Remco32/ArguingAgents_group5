 Drone strikes mostly kill low-value targets who are not significant threats to US safety and security. 
 Drones kill very few "high-value" targets with alleged leadership roles in al Qaeda or anti-US Taliban factions.  Reuters reported that of the 500 "militants" the CIA believed it had killed with drones between 2008 and 2010, only 14 were "top-tier militant targets," and 25 were "mid-to-high-level organizers" of al Qaeda, the Taliban, or other hostile groups.  The CIA had killed around 12 times more low-level fighters than mid-to-high-level during that same period.  According to the New America Foundation, from 2004 to 2012 an estimated 49 "militant leaders" were killed in drone strikes, constituting "2% of all drone-related fatalities."
