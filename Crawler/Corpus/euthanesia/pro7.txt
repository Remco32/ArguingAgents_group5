 "Up to the age of 90 I was enjoying life, but not now. It has passed me by, and I have done the best I can with it. My abilities and eyesight are declining, and I no longer want to live this way. I am happy to have this opportunity [physician-assisted suicide], which I call the Swiss option. I hope something positive will come out of my story and that other countries will adopt a more liberal view of assisted suicide. I'd like to be remembered as an instrument for freeing the elderly to choose their own death."
