 "[D]octor-prescribed suicide is not needed. Under existing law, every patient and/or his designated decision-maker has the right to refuse prolonging life by artificial means. No one has to linger indefinitely when natural causes would lead to death… The most fundamental part of a doctor-patient relationship is trust. If doctor-prescribed suicide were legal, patients wouldn't know if the doctor's ultimate motive was to heal them or end their life. The doctor's duty is to kill the pain - not the patient."
