 Social media offers teachers a platform for collaboration with other teachers and communication with students outside the classroom.
  More than 80% of US college and university faculty use social media; more than 50% use it for teaching; and 30% for communicating with students.  Educators from around the world interact with each other and bring guest teachers, librarians, authors, and experts into class via social media sites like Twitter and social networking tools like Skype.  Edmodo, an education-specific social networking site designed for contact between students, teachers, and parents, reached over 65.5 million users in 2016.
