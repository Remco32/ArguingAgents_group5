 Social media enables "sexting," which can lead to criminal charges and the unexpected proliferation of personal images.
  Almost 40% of teens report "sexting" - posting or sending sexually suggestive messages - with 22% of teen girls and 18% of teen boys posting nude or semi-nude photos.  As a result, teens and adults are being charged with possessing and distributing child pornography, even when the teen took and distributed a photo of him/herself.  88% of private self-produced sexual images posted to social media are stolen by pornography websites and disseminated to the public, often without the subject's knowledge.
