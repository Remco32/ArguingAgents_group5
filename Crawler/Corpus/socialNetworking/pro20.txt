 Social media offers a way for musicians and artists to build audiences even if they don't have a corporate contract.
  64% of teenagers listen to music on YouTube, making it the "hit-maker" for songs rather than radio (56%) or CDs (50%).  Pop star Justin Bieber was discovered on YouTube when he was 12 years old. In 2016 at 22 years old, Bieber's net worth was estimated at $200 million.  The National Endowment for the Arts found that people who interact with the arts online through social media and other means are almost three times more likely to attend a live event.
