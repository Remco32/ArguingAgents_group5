 Social media can endanger the military, journalists, and activists.
  The US Army notes that checking in with location based services on social media like Foursquare or Facebook could expose sensitive whereabouts and endanger military personnel and operations.  In 2015 a freelance journalist and activist was executed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) for reporting on life under the regime via Facebook.  In 2015 and 2016, a number of Bangladeshi bloggers who posted their thoughts on atheism on social media were killed by religious fundamentalists who opposed their postings.  In 2011, a blogger was found murdered by a Mexican cartel with the note "this happened to me for not understanding that I shouldn't report things on the social networks."
