 Social media aids the spread of hate groups.
  A Baylor University study examined Facebook hate groups focused on President Barack Obama and found a resurgence of racial slurs and stereotypes not seen in mainstream media in decades.  A study of English-language Twitter posts found that around 10,000 tweets per day contained racial slurs, 30% of which were deemed derogatory.  Social media can create a "'radicalization echo chamber' where followers reinforce for each other extremist propaganda and calls for violence," says John Carlin, JD, Assistant Attorney General at the Justice Department.  The Christian Identity, a faction of the white supremacist group Aryan Nations, uses social media to recruit members , and Die Auserwahlten, a skinhead crew founded in Nebraska, was created by people who had met each other on social media.
