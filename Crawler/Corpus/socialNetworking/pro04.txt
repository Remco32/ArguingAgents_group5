 Social media helps empower business women.
  Being able to connect on social networking sites gives business women a support group not readily found offline, where female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are outnumbered by male CEOs 474 to 26.  Many social media sites are dominated by women: 80% of Pinterest users,  70% of Snapchat users,  68% of Instagram users,  64% of Twitter users, and 58% of Facebook users, are women.  Business women use Twitter chats to support each other, give and receive peer knowledge, and have guest "speakers" share expert knowledge.  One.org helps African women entrepreneurs connect on social media to grow their businesses.
