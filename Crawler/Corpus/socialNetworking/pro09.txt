 Social media facilitates political change.
  Social media gives social movements a quick, no-cost method to organize, disseminate information, and mobilize people.  Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, used social media to mobilize a gun control movement following a deadly shooting at their school. The student activists used Twitter to promote nationwide protests on Mar. 24, 2018 that drew over one million participants and registered thousands of new voters.  The 2011 Egyptian uprising (part of the Arab Spring), organized largely via social media, motivated tens of thousands of protestors and ultimately led to the resignation of Egyptian President Mubarak on Feb. 11, 2011.  A July 4, 2011 tweet from @Adbusters with the hashtag #occupywallstreet started the American Occupy movement.  In 2015, the Black Lives Matter grassroots campaign addressed racism and police brutality in the United States and successfully pressured the 2016 presidential candidates to publicly address the issue.
