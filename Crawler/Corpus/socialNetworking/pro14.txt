 Social media allows for quick, easy dissemination of public health and safety information from reputable sources.
  The US military and Department of Veterans Affairs use social media to help prevent suicide.  The World Health Organization (WHO) uses social media to "disseminate health information and counter rumours," which was especially helpful after the Mar. 2011 Japanese earthquake and nuclear disaster when false information spread about ingesting salt to combat radiation.  The Boston Health Commission used social media to get information to its 4,500 Twitter followers about clinic locations and wait times for vaccines during the H1N1 outbreak.
