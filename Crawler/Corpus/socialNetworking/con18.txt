 Social media can facilitate inappropriate student-teacher relationships.
  The Texas Education Agency (TEA) opened 222 cases about "inappropriate relationships" between educators and students in the 2015-16 school year; 86 cases were investigated in 2007-2008 and education experts blame the rise of social media for this increase.  Pamela Casey, a District Attorney in Alabama who has prosecuted teachers who had relationships with students, says that social media adds to the problem: "We say and do things on social media and cell phones that we wouldn't say and do in person... As a result, there's a wall that's been removed."
