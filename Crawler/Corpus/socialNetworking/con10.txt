 Social media harms employees' productivity.
  A global online survey found that 50% of workers check or use social media at least once a day during work hours.  A survey of Irish workers found that 78% use a personal device to access social media at work.  Two-thirds of US workers with Facebook accounts access the site during work hours.  Even spending just 30 minutes a day on social media while at work would cost a 50-person company 6,500 hours of productivity a year.  A Pew Research Center study found that 56% of workers who use social media for work-related purposes think it distracts them from the work they need to do.
