 Social media spreads information faster than any other media.
  78.5% of traditional media reporters polled used social media to check for breaking news.  59% of Twitter users and 31% of Facebook users polled followed breaking news on these sites.  Social media sites are one of the top news sources for 46% of Americans, compared to 66% for television, 26% for printed newspapers, and 23% for radio.  Social media users have been responsible for reporting events before traditional media outlets, including the Paris attacks in France on Nov. 13, 2015 (Twitter, Facebook, and Vine),  the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria and Sierra Leone in July 2014 (Twitter),  the Boston marathon bombing on Apr. 15, 2013 (Twitter),  and the Aurora, CO, theater shooting on July 20, 2012 (Twitter and YouTube).  President Donald Trump said that the immediacy that Twitter affords him is the reason why he tweets, noting that press conferences and press releases take too long to reach the public.
