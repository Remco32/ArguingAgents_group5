 Social media helps senior citizens feel more connected to society.
  According to a 2015 Pew Research Center study, the 65 and older age group is one of the fastest growing demographic groups on social media sites, with usage rising from 2% of seniors in 2008 to 35% in 2015.  Seniors report feeling happier due to online contact with family and access to information like church bulletins that have moved online and out of print.
