 Social media allows for rapid communication during crisis events.
  Over one-third of federal, state, and local law enforcement professionals surveyed say that they use social media to notify the public of emergencies or disasters.  Facebook allows users in a crisis region to mark themselves as safe and check to see that friends and family are safe,  such as after the Apr. 2015 Nepal earthquake, the Sep. 2015 Chile earthquake, and the Nov. 2015 Paris terrorist attacks.  During the Paris terrorist attacks, Parisians tweeted their personal address alongside the hashtag #PorteOuverte (French for "open door") to offer shelter to people who were stranded.  In the aftermath of the Sydney caf√© hostage situation in Australia in Dec. 2014, local residents tweeted their routes to work with the hashtag #IllRideWithYou to offer support to Muslims in fear of an Islamophobic backlash.
