 Children may endanger themselves by not understanding the public and viral nature of social media.
  The 2012 film , about an out of control high school house party due to social media promotion, prompted copycat parties across the US resulting in arrests for vandalism, criminal trespassing, and other offenses.  Up to 600 Dutch riot police had to be called in to break up a teen's birthday party to which about 30,000 people were accidentally invited after a Facebook post thought to be private went viral.  A similar incident happened in Los Angeles and resulted in the teen host beaten and hospitalized.
