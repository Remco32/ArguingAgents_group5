 Social media can help disarm social stigmas.
  The Sticks and Stones campaign uses Twitter to reduce stigmas surrounding mental health and learning disabilities.  The Stigma Project uses Facebook to "lower the HIV infection rate and neutralize stigma through education via social media and advertising."  Gay people speaking openly on social media, like Facebook site Wipe Out Homophobia, help achieve a greater social acceptance of homosexuality.  Jenny Lawson, author of the blog "The Bloggess" and  bestseller , has made public her struggles with OCD, depression, and anxiety disorders, which has lessened the stigma of the diseases for others.
