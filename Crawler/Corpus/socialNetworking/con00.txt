 Social media enables the spread of unreliable and false information.
  64% of people who use Twitter for news say that they have encountered something they "later discovered wasn't true," and 16% of Twitter news users say that "they had retweeted or posted a tweet they later discovered to be false."  A study published in the journal  found that lies spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter, and "fake news" is retweeted more often than true news.  In the three months prior to the 2016 US presidential election, false news stories about the two candidates were shared a total of 37.6 million times on Facebook.  A federal grand jury indictment announced in Feb. 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller said that a Russian group created phony social media accounts "to reach significant numbers of Americans for purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system."  A University of Michigan study found that even when false information is corrected, the number of people who see or share the correction via social media is lower than number who saw or shared the false information in the first place.
