 Social media lacks privacy and exposes users to government and corporate intrusions.
  81% of people surveyed feel "not very" or "not at all" secure when using social media sites to share private information.  48% of people reported some difficulty in managing their privacy settings.  13 million users said they had not set or did not know about Facebook's privacy settings.  The US government submitted 36,812 requests for data from Facebook and 7,036 requests from Twitter in 2015, approximately 80% of which were honored at least in part.  The National Security Agency (NSA) can monitor social media activity and read the content of private social media messages simply by entering a person's username into their system.  Contego Services Group, which specialize in worker compensation claims, has a unit dedicated to social media monitoring to detect fraud.
