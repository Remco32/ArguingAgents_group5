 Social media sites' advertising practices may constitute an invasion of privacy.
  An ExactTarget marketing report tells companies, "When a user clicks on a [Facebook] like button belonging to your brand, you're immediately granted access to additional information about this customer, from school affiliation and workplace information to their birthdate and other things they like… [M]arketers can access and leverage data in ways that will truly alarm customers."  From social media sites, simple algorithms can determine where you live, sexual orientation, personality traits, signs of depression, and alma maters among other information, even if users put none of those data on their social media profiles.
