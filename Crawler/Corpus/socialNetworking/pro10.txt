 Social media is good for the economy.
  Social media sites have created a new major industry and thousands of jobs.  A McKinsey Global Institute study projected that the communication and collaboration from social media added between $900 billion and $1.3 trillion to the economy through added productivity and improved customer service.  A report by Deloitte found that "Facebook added $227 billion and 4.5 million jobs to the global economy in 2014."  Facebook posted $5.38 billion for first quarter 2016 revenue, up from $3.54 billion for first quarter 2015 earnings.  Snapchat was valued at $24 billion the day its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
