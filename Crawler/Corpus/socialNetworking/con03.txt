 Social media can lead to stress and offline relationship problems.
  31% of teens who use social media have fought with a friend because of something that happened online.  A 2016 study found that overuse of social media as an adolescent may decrease success in relationships later in life as online communication hinders the development of conflict management skills and awareness of interpersonal cues.  One study found that the more Facebook friends a person has, the more stressful Facebook is to use.  Researchers have found that "active Twitter use leads to greater amounts of Twitter-related conflict among romantic partners, which in turn leads to infidelity, breakup, and divorce."
