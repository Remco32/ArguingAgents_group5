 Law enforcement uses social media to catch and prosecute criminals.
  73% of federal, state, and local law enforcement professionals surveyed think "social media helps solve crimes more quickly."  A survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police found that 85% of police departments use social media to solve crimes.  The New York Police Department was one of the first forces to add a Twitter tracking unit and use social networking to arrest criminals who have bragged of their crimes online.  Social media sites have helped in the prosecution and conviction of a number of crimes, including: a professional soccer player charged with inappropriate activity with a minor in the UK in 2016,  a gang charged with the beating of a gay couple in Philadelphia, PA, in 2014,  and rioting hockey fans in Vancouver (Canada) in 2011.
