 Social media can entice people to waste time.
  A survey of internet users aged 16-64 found that the average daily time spent on social media is 1.72 hours, which accounts for 28% of total time spent online.  36% of people surveyed listed social media as the "biggest waste of time," above fantasy sports (25%), watching TV (23%), and shopping (9%).  When alerted to new social media activity, such as a new tweet or Facebook message, users take 20 to 25 minutes on average to return to the original task. In 30% of cases, it took two hours to fully return attention to the original task.
