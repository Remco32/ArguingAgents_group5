 Social media facilitates face-to-face interaction.
  People use social media to network at in-person events and get to know people before personal, business, and other meetings.  Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project found that messaging on social media leads to face-to-face interactions when plans are made via the sites and social media users messaged close friends an average of 39 days each year while seeing close friends in person 210 days each year.
