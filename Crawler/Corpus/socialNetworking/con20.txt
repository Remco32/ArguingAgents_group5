 Using social media can harm students' chances for college admission.
  College administrators scan Facebook profiles for evidence of illegal behavior by students.  A 2016 Kaplan Test Prep survey found that 35% of college admissions officers checked an applicant's social media to learn more about them, up from 10% in 2008. 42% of these admissions officers discovered information that had a negative impact on prospective students' admission chances.  In 2014, only 3% of students surveyed believed the content of their social media presence could hurt their prospects of admission.
