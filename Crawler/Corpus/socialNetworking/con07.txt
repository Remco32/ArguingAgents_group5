 Social media causes people to spend less time interacting face-to-face.
  A USC Annenberg School study found that the percentage of people reporting less face-to-face time with family in their homes rose from 8% in 2000 to 34% in 2011.  32% reported using social media or texting during meals (47% of 18-34 year olds)  instead of talking with family and friends. 10% of people younger than 25 years old respond to social media and text messages during sex.
