 The use of social media is correlated with personality and brain disorders.
  A University of Pittsburgh study found that social media use was "significantly associated with increased depression" amongst adults aged between 19 and 32.  Another study found that addictive social media use reflected increased narcissistic personality traits.  Researchers have found that "interruptions due to phone notifications can cause inattention and hyperactivity in the general population."  A UK government study found that 41% of children who spend over three hours on social media on a normal school day reportedly suffer from mental health difficulties compared with 21% who spend no time on the sites.
