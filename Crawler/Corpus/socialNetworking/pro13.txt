 Social media helps people who are socially isolated or shy connect with other people.
  More than 25% of teens report that social media makes them feel less shy, 28% report feeling more outgoing, and 20% report feeling more confident (53% of teens identified as somewhat shy or "a lot" shy in general).  Youth who are "less socially adept" report that social media gives them a place to make friends  and typically quiet students can feel more comfortable being vocal through a social media platform used in class.  Shy adults also cite social media as a comfortable place to interact with others.
