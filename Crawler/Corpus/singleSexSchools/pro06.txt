 Single-sex institutions are bad for the emotional health of males 
 The positive health effects of single-sex schools pointed out in the same Dr. Leonard study outweigh the emotional distress potentially felt by a minority of divorced men. Regarding the majority, the research found ‘those who stayed together were just as likely to be happy in their relationship as men educated in mixed schools’. As for girls, the findings suggest they ‘seem to learn what the nature of the beast is’ without needing to learn alongside boys, whilst a central finding of the study is that ‘single-sex moderates the effect of gender-stereotyping in terms of choice of field of study’.
