 Boys and girls develop at different times and speeds, therefore they should be taught separately
 Everyone develops at slightly different speeds, however few would advocate everyone should be home-schooled. Ultimately, the curriculum determines the mode of teaching, not the gender composition of the class, and the curriculum can be moulded to suit both girls and boys, faster and slower learners and those with under-developed hand-motor control. If elementary school boys are being forced to repeat grades that is a manifestation of difficulties in learning and as relevant to their proximity to girls in the classroom as it is to the higher-achieving boys. Furthermore, the sociologist Cynthia Epstein argues that in fact ‘there is no consensus among psychologists as to the existence of psychological or cognitive differences between the sexes’. Finally, as Michael Bronski notes, the benefits of same-sex schools cannot be applied across the educational sphere for the private schools where the tests take place admit ‘either only high-achieving pupils or self-select by expelling poorly-performing or misbehaving students’.
