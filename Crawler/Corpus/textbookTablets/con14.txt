 Many textbooks are not available in digital format or on the specific tablet used by a school.
  As of 2012, only 30% of textbook titles are available electronically. There are many different companies that manufacture tablets, and most contract with one specific e-book seller. This means that some textbooks may not be sold across all tablets.
