 Tablets lower the amount of paper teachers have to print for handouts and assignments, helping to save the environment and money.
  A school with 100 teachers uses on average 250,000 pieces of paper annually.  A school of 1,000 students on average spends between $3,000-4,000 a month on paper, ink, and toner, not counting printer wear and tear or technical support costs.
