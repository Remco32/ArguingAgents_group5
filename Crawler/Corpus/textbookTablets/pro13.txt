 Students who own tablets purchase and read more books than those who read print books alone.
  The average tablet-owning US student reads 24 books per year on a tablet compared with 15 in print for those who do not own a tablet.  According to a survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 30% of e-content readers (including 40% of those under age 30) say that they now spend more time reading than they used to due to the availability of e-content.
