 People who read print text comprehend more, remember more, and learn more than those who read digital text.
  The brain interprets printed and digital text in different ways, and people generally read digital text 20-30% slower than print.   According to Pulitzer Prize winning technology writer Nicholas Carr, peer-reviewed studies show that reading hyper-linked text may increase the brain's "cognitive load," lowering the ability to process, store, and retain information, or "translate the new material into conceptual knowledge."  In addition, students who type lecture notes instead of write their notes by hand tended to write more, process less, and perform worse on recall tests.
