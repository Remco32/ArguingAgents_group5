 Gay couples make good parents. 
 A June 2014 peer-reviewed University of Melbourne study showed that children raised by same-sex parents score about six percent higher than the general population on measures of general health and family cohesion.  A study published in Pediatrics on June 7, 2010 found that children of lesbian mothers were rated higher than children of heterosexual parents in social and academic competence and had fewer social problems.  A July 2010 study found that children of gay fathers were "as well-adjusted as those adopted by heterosexual parents."  As former Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein wrote, "We should be begging gay couples to adopt children. We should see this as a great boon that gay marriage could bring to kids who need nothing more than two loving parents."  In the United States, around 115,000 children are waiting to be adopted.
