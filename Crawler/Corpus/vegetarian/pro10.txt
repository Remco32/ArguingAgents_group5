 A vegetarian diet promotes a healthy weight. 
 According to a peer-reviewed 2003 Oxford University study of 37,875 healthy men and women aged 20-97, 5.4% of meat eaters were obese compared to 3% of vegetarians. Meat eaters had an average Body Mass Index (BMI) 8.3% higher than vegetarians.  Another 2006 meta-study that compiled data from 87 studies also found that vegetarian diets are associated with reduced body weight.
