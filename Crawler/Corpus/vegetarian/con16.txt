 Modern slaughter techniques minimize the suffering of animals. 
 US slaughterhouses must conform to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) which mandates that livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter.  Many of the largest US meat producers also adhere to the handling standards developed by Dr. Temple Grandin   which factor in animal psychology to design transportation devices, stockyards, loading ramps, and restraining systems that minimize stress and calm animals as they are led to slaughter.
