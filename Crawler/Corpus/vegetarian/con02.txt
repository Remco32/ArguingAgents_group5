 Meat is the most convenient protein source available. 
 In one serving, meat provides all the essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), as well as essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, and B vitamins.  Most plant foods do not provide adequate levels of all the essential amino acids in a single serving.
