 It is cruel and unethical to kill animals for food when vegetarian options are available. 
 Animals are sentient beings that have emotions and social connections. Scientific studies show that cattle, pigs, chickens, and all warm-blooded animals can experience stress, pain, and fear.  In the United States about 35 million cows, 115 million pigs, and 9 billion birds are killed for food each year.  These animals should not have to die to satisfy an unnecessary dietary preference.
