 There is nothing inherently cruel about raising animals for food. 
 There is a growing movement to raise "cruelty free" organic meat. In the United States, animals raised for certified organic meat must be given access to the outdoors, clean air, and water. They cannot be given growth hormones or antibiotics and must be fed organically-grown feed free of animal byproducts.  According to a 2007 report from the Range Improvement Task Force, organic meat accounted for 3% of total US meat production.  By the end of 2012 "natural and organic" beef accounted for 4% of total beef sales in the United States.
