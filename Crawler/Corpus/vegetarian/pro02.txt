 A vegetarian diet delivers complete nutrition and can provide health benefits. 
 According to the American Dietetic Association, a vegetarian diet can meet protein requirements, provide all the essential amino-acids (the building blocks of protein), and improve health. It can also provide all the necessary vitamins, fats, and minerals, and can improve one’s health.   According to the USDA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, meat is not an essential part of a healthy diet.
