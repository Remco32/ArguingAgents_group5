 Raising beef is often the most efficient way to produce food for humans. 
 About 85% of US grazing land is not suitable for raising crops humans can eat.  Today 98% of the original American prairie lands, along with their native plants and animals, are gone.  Most of that land is now covered in corn and wheat fields. Natural prairie grasslands can coexist with sustainable herds of cattle or bison, but they cannot coexist with monocrop agriculture.
