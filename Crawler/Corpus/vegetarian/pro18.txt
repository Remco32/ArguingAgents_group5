 Raising animals in confinement is cruel. 
 About 50% of meat produced in the United States comes from  (CAFOs)  where animals live in filthy, overcrowded spaces. In CAFOs pigs have their tails cut off, chickens have their toenails and beaks clipped off, and cows have their horns removed and tails cut off with no painkillers.  Pregnant pigs are kept in metal gestation crates barely bigger than they are.  Baby cows raised for veal are tied up and confined in tiny stalls their entire short lives (3-18 weeks).
