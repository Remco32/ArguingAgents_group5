 Eating meat increases the risk of getting type 2 diabetes. 
 A peer-reviewed 2004 study from Harvard researchers found that eating meat increases the risk of getting type 2 diabetes in women,  and a 2002 study found that eating processed meat increases the risk in men.  A vegetarian diet rich in whole grains, legumes, nuts, and soy proteins helps to improve glycemic control in people who already have diabetes.
