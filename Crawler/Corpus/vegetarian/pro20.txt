 Eating fish is not more ethical, environmentally sound, or healthful than eating other animal protein sources. 
 The US EPA states that "nearly all fish and shellfish" are contaminated by methylmercury (a potent neurotoxin) from industrial pollution.   The omega-3 acid ALA found in vegetarian sources like walnut, flax, and olive oils, is converted by the body into EPA and DHA—the essential omega-3 acids found in fish—and sufficient to meet the dietary needs of humans.  In addition, scientific studies show fish feel pain when they are injured,  and wild fish are severely impacted by overfishing. According to a peer-reviewed 2006 study published in , 29% of all commercially fished species have suffered population collapse, and at current fishing levels all harvested species will have collapsed by 2048.
