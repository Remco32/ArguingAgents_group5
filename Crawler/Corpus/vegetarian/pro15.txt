 Producing one hamburger destroys 55 square feet of rainforest. 
  Between 1996-2006, 25 million acres of Amazon rainforest were clearedâ€”80% of which became pasture for beef cattle.  In 2009, the United States imported 44,284 tons  of processed Brazilian beef mostly for use in hamburgers, hot dogs, and lunch meats. Importing fresh Brazilian beef became legal in Nov. 2010, and US beef imports from Brazil will likely increase.
