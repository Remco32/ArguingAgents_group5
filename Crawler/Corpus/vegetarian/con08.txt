 Vegetarian diets are not necessarily better for the environment. 
 About 90% of US cropland suffers from top soil loss at 13 times the sustainable rate.  92% of US soybeans (a vegetarian staple protein) are planted with genetically modified soy, immune to herbicides.  This immunity allows soy farmers to douse their fields with large quantities of weed-killing herbicides which are toxic to other plants and fish. Some scientists worry that increased herbicide use could create "super weeds."
