 A vegetarian diet can help alleviate world hunger. 
 Over 10 pounds of plant protein are used to produce one pound of beef protein.  If these grains were fed to humans instead of animals, more food would be available for the 925 million people in chronic hunger worldwide.  Research from Cornell University found that the grain used to feed US livestock alone could feed 800 million people.
