 Processed vegetarian protein options such as tofu can cause more greenhouse gas pollution than farming meat. 
 A 2010 report from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) found that the production of soy-based proteins such as tofu could contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than eating locally produced meat.  According to a peer-reviewed 2009 study, giving up all animal products would only give a 7% reduction in green house gas emissions,  not enough to be worth the dietary sacrifice.
