 A vegetarian diet helps build healthy bones because vegetarians absorb more calcium than meat eaters. 
 Meat has high renal acid levels which the body must neutralize by leaching calcium from the bones, which is then passed into urine and lost.  There are many sources of healthy vegetarian calcium including tofu, dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens, as well as fortified cereals.
