 US meat consumption does not significantly contribute to global deforestation, or loss of US forest land. 
 In 2001 about 95%  of animal products consumed in the United States were produced in the United States. Despite the US consumption of about 27 billion pounds of beef per year,  the percentage of forested US land has remained steady at around 33% since 1907.
