 Overgrazing livestock hurts the environment through soil compaction, erosion, and harm to native plants and animals. 
 About 70% of the 11 western states are grazed by livestock.  Grazing has been a factor in the listing of 171 species under the Endangered Species Act.  It has damaged 80% of streams and riparian areas in the western United States.  85% of US land used for grazing livestock is not suitable for farming.  Abstaining from meat would help in the restoration of vast US lands more naturally suited to provide habitat for native plants and animals.
