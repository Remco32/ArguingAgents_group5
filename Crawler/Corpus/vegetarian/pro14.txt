 A vegetarian diet leads to lower greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Greenhouse gases are created by  (aka animal farts and burps), manure decomposition, and deforestation to make room for grazing animals and growing feed. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, raising animals for food creates 18% of global greenhouse gases - more than the transportation sector.  Producing a pound of hamburger meat contributes as much greenhouse gas as driving a small car nearly 20 miles. A pound of pork equals about 5 miles, and a pound of potatoes only 0.34 miles.  A June 2014 peer-reviewed study found that diets including meat cause the creation of up to 54% more greenhouse gas emissions than vegetarian diets.  According to the United Nations Environment Programme, a "worldwide diet change away from animal products" is necessary to stop the worst effects of global climate change.
