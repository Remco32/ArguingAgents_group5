 Studies show that vegetarians are up to 40% less likely to develop cancer than meat eaters. 
 According to a peer-reviewed 1994 study by Harvard researchers, consuming beef, pork, or lamb five or more times a week significantly increases the risk of colon cancer.  The World Cancer Research Fund found that eating processed meats such as bacon or sausage increases this risk even further.  A 2014 study found that diets high in animal protein were associated with a 4-fold increase in cancer death risk compared to high protein diets based on plant-derived protein sources.
