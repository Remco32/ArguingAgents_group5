 High-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder.
  A  investigation found that high-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012.  When high-capacity magazines were used in mass shootings, the death rate rose 63% and the injury rate rose 156%.  David H. Chipman, Senior Vice President of Public Safety for ShotSpotter and former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agent, stated that a high-capacity magazine "turns a killer into a killing machine."  Some gang members use high-capacity magazines, such as 30 rounds or even 90 rounds, to compensate for lack of accuracy and maximize the chance to harm.
