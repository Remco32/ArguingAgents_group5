 Gun control efforts have proved ineffective. 
 According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, "there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates."  Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The "gun show loophole" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws.  According to a Mar. 10, 2016  study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates.
