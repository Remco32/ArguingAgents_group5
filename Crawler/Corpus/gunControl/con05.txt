 Gun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens.
  57% of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would "give too much power to the government over the people."  The NRA's Wayne LaPierre stated, "if you look at why our Founding Fathers put it [the Second Amendment] there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny."  Alex Jones, radio host, in a Jan 7, 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, stated, "The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting, it's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugsâ€¦ 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!"
