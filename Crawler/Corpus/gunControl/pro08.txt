 More gun control leads to fewer suicides.
  Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years.  According to a Mar. 2014 study, when gun ownership went down in the United States, overall suicide rates went down.   Firearm-related suicides accounted for 61% of the gun deaths in the United States between 2000 and 2010.  A Dec. 2009 study found "general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed."  In Indiana and Connecticut, after "red flag" laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted, gun suicides decreased by 7.5% and 13.7% respectively, while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time.   A person who wants to kill him/herself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable.
