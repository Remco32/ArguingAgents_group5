 "There's no 'medical' [marijuana]. This is one of the great hoaxes of all time. The bottom line is, I'm told marijuana is much stronger today than it was 20-30 years ago. I don't have any personal experience, but in terms of today. So that's one problem. And number two, drug dealers have families to feed. If they can't sell marijuana, they'll sell something else. And the something else is gonna be worse. The push to legalize this is just wrong headed. If you think about what they say, 'It's not gonna hurt anybody, it doesn't lead to dependency.' Of course it does... This stuff is very dangerous."
