 Marijuana use harms the brain, and legalization will increase mental health problems.
  Cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. Â Researchers at Harvard and Northwestern found that recreational marijuana smokers showed abnormalities in the shape, volume, and density of certain areas of the brain. Dr. Hans Breiter, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital who co-authored the study, said, "People think a little marijuana shouldn't cause a problem if someone is doing O.K. with work or school. Our data directly says this is not so."  A  study stated, "There is good evidence that taking cannabis leads to acute adverse mental effects in a high proportion of regular users." A survey published in  journal reported that 22% of marijuana users experienced "acute anxiety or panic attacks following cannabis use," and 15% had psychotic symptoms following use.
