 The government doesn't have the right to tell adults what they can put in their own bodies.
  David Boaz, Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute, said, "people have the right to live their lives in any way they choose so long as they don't violate the equal rights of others. What right could be more basic, more inherent in human nature, than the right to choose what substances to put in one's own body?"  More than 3,500 people die from drowning every year in the United States, but the government wouldn't arrest people for owning swimming pools.  Over 30,000 people are killed annually in car accidents, but the government doesn't outlaw driving.  Adults should be allowed to make adult decisions about how they choose to relax or have fun without government interference, especially when they're not hurting anyone. US Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) said, "There is no doubt in my mind that the federal government should not be in the marijuana prohibition business... From every perspective—a libertarian perspective, fiscal conservative's perspective, Christian evangelical perspective, progressive perspective—marijuana prohibition is just wrong."
