 Taxes collected from the legal sale of marijuana support important public programs.
  Tax revenues in legal marijuana states provide funding to the police, drug treatment and mental health centers, and housing programs, along with school programs such as anti-bullying campaigns, youth mentoring, and public school grants.  "The impact is really felt at the local level. Some counties have done 20 years of infrastructure work in just one year's time. They've provided lunch for kids who need it," said Brian Vicente, partner at Vicente Sederberg LLC, a law firm specializing in the marijuana industry. In Colorado, $40 million of marijuana tax revenue went to public school construction, while $105 million went to housing programs, mental health programs in jails, and health programs in middle schools in 2016-2017.
