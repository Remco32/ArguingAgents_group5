 The United States has signed international treaties that prevent us from legalizing marijuana.
  Three United Nations treaties set worldwide drug controls.  As a party to the treaties, the United States has agreed to limit the use of marijuana "exclusively to medical and scientific purposes."  The move by some US states to legalize adult-use marijuana has upset the UN monitoring organization, which stated that legalization "cannot be reconciled with the legal obligation" to uphold the Single Convention treaty. Legalizing marijuana puts the United States in a position of weakness when we need to hold other nations accountable to legal agreements.  "It is a path the United States—with its strong interest in international institutions and the rule of law—should tread with great caution," wrote Wells Bennett, a Fellow in National Security Law at the Brookings Institution, and John Walsh, Senior Associate at the Washington Office on Latin America.
