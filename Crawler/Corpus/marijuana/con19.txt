 Legalizing marijuana is opposed by major public health organizations.
  Some of the public health associations that oppose legalizing marijuana for recreational use include the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. "Legalization campaigns that imply that marijuana is a benign substance present a significant challenge for educating the public about its known risks and adverse effects," the American Academy of Pediatrics said.  The ASAM "does not support the legalization of marijuana and recommends that jurisdictions that have not acted to legalize marijuana be most cautious and not adopt a policy of legalization until more can be learned."  The AMA "believes that (1) cannabis is a dangerous drug and as such is a public health concern; (2) sale of cannabis should not be legalized."
