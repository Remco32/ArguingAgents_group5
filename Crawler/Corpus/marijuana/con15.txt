 Marijuana harms the health of users and people around them.
  Smoking marijuana can damage lung tissues and cause respiratory problems; secondhand marijuana smoke is also dangerous.  Research shows that smoking one marijuana joint is as damaging to the lungs as five tobacco cigarettes.  Marijuana may contain five times as much carbon monoxide concentration and three times as much tar as tobacco. There is a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes in the hours immediately after smoking cannabis. A study found that using a vaporization device "likely leads to enhanced ingestion of toxic ammonia known to result in neurobehavioral impairment."  Ammonia ingested while vaping can result in lung irritation, nervous system effects, and asthma attacks.
