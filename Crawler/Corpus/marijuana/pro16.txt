 Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, which are already legal.
  Alcohol and tobacco are legal, yet they are known to cause cancer, heart failure, liver damage, and more. According to the CDC, six people die from alcohol poisoning every day and 88,000 people die annually due to excessive alcohol use in the United States.  There are no recorded cases of death from marijuana overdose. Three to four times as many Americans are dependent on alcohol as on marijuana.  A study in the  ranking the harmfulness of drugs put alcohol first as the most harmful, tobacco as sixth, and cannabis eighth.  A national poll found that people view tobacco as a greater threat to health than marijuana by a margin of four to one (76% vs. 18%), and 72% of people surveyed believed that regular use of alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana use. "In several respects, even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation's health than pot," said Dr. David L. Nathan, a clinical psychiatrist and president of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation.
