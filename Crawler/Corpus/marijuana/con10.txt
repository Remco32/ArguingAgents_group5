 Traffic accidents and deaths increase when marijuana is legalized.
  Marijuana-related traffic deaths rose 62% following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado.  Jim Leal, former Chief of Police of Newark, California, said of legalizing marijuana, "You are commercializing a product that is just going to put more impaired drivers on the road, worsening a problem that we already have. What officers are seeing with THC levels being very high is they are seeing impairment being far worse than they have ever seen in the past." The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported that fatal crashes involving marijuana doubled after legalization in Washington. Marshall Doney, President and CEO of AAA, said, "Marijuana can affect driver safety by impairing vehicle control and judgment."  The Highway Loss Data Institute found an increased crash risk in legal marijuana states and said collision claims in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington are higher than they would be without legal marijuana.
