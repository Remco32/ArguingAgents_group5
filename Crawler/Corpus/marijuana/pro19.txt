 A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana.
  A 2017 Gallup poll found a record-high 64% support for legalizing marijuana, up from 12% in 1969, the first year the polling company asked about marijuana.  The poll first surpassed 50% support in 2011. According to Gallup, "the transformation in public attitudes about marijuana over the past half-century has mirrored the liberalization of public attitudes about gay rights and the same-sex-marriage movement."  While Democrats (72%) and Independents (67%) have been more likely to back legalization, a majority of Republicans (51%) now agree.  Polls by CBS News and the AP both found that 61% of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. The public clearly supports changing our failed anti-marijuana policies.  More than half of US states have legalized medical marijuana, and 40 states took some action to relax their drug laws (such as decriminalizing or lowering penalties for possession) between 2009 and 2013.
