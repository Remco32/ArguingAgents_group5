  Heavy users who stop using marijuana may suffer withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, nausea, chills, and stomach pain.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as many as four million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder, such as abuse, dependence, or addiction.  Dr. Drew Pinsky, a board-certified internist and addiction medicine specialist, said, "I've been treating cannabis addiction for 20 years. When people are addicted to cannabis, cocaine and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis." A study in the  found that the number of US daily marijuana users has risen dramatically since 2002 and now 68% of users report daily or near-daily use.  Kevin Sabet, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, wrote, "The scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous... Many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today's marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past."
