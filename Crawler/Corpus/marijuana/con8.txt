 Legalized marijuana creates steep costs for society and taxpayers that far outweigh its tax revenues.
  Marijuana use harms more than just the person using the drug.  Societal costs of marijuana use include paying for increased emergency room visits, medical care, and addiction treatment for the uninsured; more victims of drugged driving accidents; increased crime; and a negative impact on health from secondhand smoke. Annual societal costs from alcohol ($223.5 billion) and tobacco ($193 billion) far exceed the $24 billion in tax revenues they raise.  Money raised from legal marijuana taxes generally accounts for less than 1% of a state's tax revenue.  Legalizing marijuana would put one more harmful substance in our society that costs more than the revenue it generates.  According to the Pew Research Center, "the most frequently mentioned reason why people oppose legalization is that marijuana generally hurts society."
