 Legalizing marijuana would end the costly enforcement of marijuana laws and free up police resources.
  Arresting people for marijuana possession costs the United States between $1.19 billion and $6.03 billion annually.  These costs include police, judicial, legal, and corrections expenses. Incarcerating marijuana offenders costs the United States an estimated $600 million per year.  Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has estimated that marijuana legalization would save between $7.7 billion and $13.7 billion annually. Instead of arresting people for marijuana, police officers could focus on serious crimes including rape, assault, and homicide.  For example, marijuana legalization in Washington significantly freed up law enforcement resources; marijuana possession arrests dropped from 5,531 the year before legalization to 120 the year after. Howard Wooldridge, a former police detective from Michigan who co-founded LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), said, "Marijuana prohibition is a horrible waste of good police time. Every hour spent looking for pot reduces public safety."
