 The enforcement of marijuana prohibition is racist because people of color are disproportionately impacted.
  Statistics show a significant racial disparity in the enforcement of marijuana laws: even though white and black people use marijuana at roughly the same rate, a black person in the United States is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession on average.  In Iowa, the state with the highest inequity, black people are 8.3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.  In New York City, 15.8% of marijuana possession cases involving white people result in conviction, compared to 32.3% involving black people and 30% involving Hispanic people. Marijuana possession convictions can impact people's ability to get public housing, financial aid for school, loans, and jobs.  Over the past ten years, drug sentences for black men have been 9% to 13% longer than those received by white men.  Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, Criminal Justice and Drug Policy director for the ACLU of California, stated, "Racial disparities in marijuana enforcement are widespread and longstanding."  Legalizing marijuana would help correct the disparity.
