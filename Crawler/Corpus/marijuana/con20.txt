 Growing marijuana harms the environment. 
 Marijuana cultivation results in deforestation, soil erosion, habitat destruction, and river diversion.  Cannabis plants require nearly double the amount of water needed to grow grapes or tomatoes.  Rosamond Naylor, Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said, "Taking water directly from rivers and streams in the summer [to grow marijuana] not only reduces the water available for agriculture but also threatens wildlife species... Regardless of the legal status of marijuana, the way we are currently managing its impacts on water and wildlife in California just doesn't work." Legal indoor growing requires a lot of electricity for lighting, heating, and ventilation. This produces an amount of greenhouse gas emissions equal to that of three million cars each year, and places a burden on public utilities.
