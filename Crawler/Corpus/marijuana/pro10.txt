 Traffic deaths and arrests for DUIs do not increase, and may decrease, when marijuana is legalized.
  Traffic deaths dropped 11% on average in states that legalized medical marijuana.  Arrests for driving under the influence have decreased in Washington and Colorado.  Benjamin Hansen, an economics professor at the University of Oregon at Eugene who studied traffic deaths post-medical marijuana legalization, stated that "Public safety doesn't decrease with increased access to marijuana, rather it improves." Studies show that drivers under the influence of marijuana tend to be more cautious and take fewer risks than drunk drivers, such as making fewer lane changes and reducing speed.  A fact sheet about marijuana's effects on drivers posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration website stated that "Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment."
