 Legalizing marijuana creates thousands of needed jobs.
  There were an estimated 122,814 legal full-time marijuana jobs in the United States as of Jan. 2017.  A report from New Frontier Data found that the cannabis industry could create a quarter of a million new jobs by 2020.  An economic impact estimate from the Marijuana Policy Group forecast the creation of more than 130,000 jobs in California following legalization.  Within a few years of legalization, approximately 18,000 additional full-time jobs were created in Colorado annually, both in the actual marijuana business as well as in related fields such as security and real estate.  Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) stated that the cannabis industry in the United States "is expected to produce nearly 300,000 jobs by 2020 and grow to $24 billion by 2025."
