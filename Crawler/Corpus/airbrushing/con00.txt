 Objectification of womenâ€™s bodies
 Airbrushing is sometimes objectifying. But it does not have to be so. A ban is a blunt instrument; it would be banning both objectifying images and those that are art or intended to make a point. Dealing with objectification is not best done with a ban as it is a much broader issue than airbrushing. Images can objectifying without airbrushing; these would remain. This sticking plaster of a policy would therefore be downright unhelpful by merely covering up the real issue.
