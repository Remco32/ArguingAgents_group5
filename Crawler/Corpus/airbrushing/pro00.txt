 Objectification of women’s bodies
 Airbrushing is part of the objectification – seeing something simply as an object rather than an individual – of women’s bodies; it degrades individuals treating women merely as an object, often of sexual desire. Images being photoshopped is a part of this and an indicator; for any image that has been photoshopped the reason is almost certainly to make it look more attractive and sexually appealing. It is morally wrong to be using, and often making money from, images that are degrading.
