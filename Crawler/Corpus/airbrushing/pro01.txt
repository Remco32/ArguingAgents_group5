 Leads to eating disorders and other harmful effects
 Photoshopping women’s bodies is not just morally wrong, it can cause real physical harm. Having ultra-thin photoshopped models helps to normalise having a body that is thin; it becomes the expected or normal thing. The readership of the media that carries these images will increasingly measure themselves against that norm that has been created in the media. In the vast majority of cases they will find themselves wanting.Many who compare themselves are likely to suffer psychologically. If young women who have a normal body compare themselves to these images they are likely to suffer from lower self-esteem. The media is a powerful influence. There will be those who attempt to match these unnaturally thin bodies leading to conditions like anorexia and other eating disorders. Those who realise that they can’t match the image are often excessively influenced by culture and perceived peer pressure, the more people conform to the norm the greater the pressure from various points such as groups of friends. Anorexia can be immensely harmful, it has the highest death rate of any psychiatric illness, with 20% of sufferers dying prematurely. We need to do anything we can to combat it, including banning these images that encourage it.
