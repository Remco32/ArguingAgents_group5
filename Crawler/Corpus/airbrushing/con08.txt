 A ban may make the problem worse
 There are advantages to allowing photoshopping of women’s bodies. The women involved may wish to remove blemishes and make themselves looks slightly thinner. Importantly the use of software to do this potentially allows almost anyone to be shown how they want to appear. People with some blemish that may rule them out of being in the media can be photoshopped thus opening up the industry.The flipside of this is that if a ban is put in place those young women who might have had opportunities in the industry will be ruled out. The media is unlikely to change immediately to wanting images of a more normal body image. This means that if photoshopping is ruled out the only option is to use really thin models. As a result, anyone who wants to be a model will have to be starving themselves to achieve the image needed to get ahead.
