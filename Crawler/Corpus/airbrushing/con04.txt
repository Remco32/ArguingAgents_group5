 Freedom of Expression
 Everyone should have the right to express themselves as they wish. In the case of airbrushing the photos involve both expression by the photographer, and by the model who was photographed. Airbrushing is used in all sorts of situations in photography. We would not consider banning landscape photographers from editing out an inconvenient pylon, nor would we seek to ban the use of black and white photos or filters for dramatic effect. These are doing the same thing; making a photo more attractive through editing.
