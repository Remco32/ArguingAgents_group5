 Abdicates individual and collective responsibility to the state
 So, it is likely that a ban will not be completely successful. This immediately creates a problem of perceptions that influences responsibility; it is transferred to the state. By banning something the state takes responsibility for it, responsibility that has previously been in the hands of parents.This is a particular problem if the ban is not completely successful. With a ban in place, but some airbrushed images still being available everyone will believe the problem is fixed. People will not be on their guard against the possibility that the image is not reality. This makes any airbrushed images that get through much more powerful in their influence on those who are impressionable around body image. People are much less likely to try and match an image they know, or suspect is fake, so taking away this wariness is damaging.   This abdication of responsibility can be taken to extremes; 39% of parents ignore age ratings on games. If they have abdicated their individual responsibility to such an extent we can be sure that with a ban they would not help educate their children.
