 Allows everyone to be perfect
 It is far better that people are encouraged to be comfortable in their own bodies rather than be encouraged to think that to be ‘perfect’ they need to be airbrushed to remove any ‘imperfections’. Getting rid of those imperfections in a photo will not change the reality so it simply seems to highlight a divide between what the individual would consider their prefect selves and the reality; something which is likely to add to any psychological pressures.
