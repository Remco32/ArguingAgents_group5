 Almost impossible to achieve; images will just come from elsewhere
 No ban is ever perfect. The ban is not about catching and preventing or taking down absolutely every single photoshopped image. As with most laws however it will mostly be self managing; the media will stop commissioning airbrushing, and most will be happy to do so as it will save them money while they know that their competition can’t get ahead by using it. At the same time audiences, and models themselves, will help enforce the ban as they will be able to report any instances of photoshopping.
