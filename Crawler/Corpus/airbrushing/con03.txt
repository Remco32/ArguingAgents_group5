 Banning would help create a beneficial cultural shift
 Cultural shifts do not usually come from bans, rather in spite of them; think of the social movements overthrowing dictatorships with the most obvious being the downfall of the Eastern Bloc. Social change is about freedom. Fortunately, social change in this area is as likely to come from airbrushing as from banning it. Airbrushing sometimes becomes very obvious – either when those doing the photoshopping go too far, or when they make a mistake often resulting in missing limbs! This creates a large amount of debate around photoshopping but also wider issues. This will likely make people think about the societal issues involved in a way that a ban will not; once something is banned everything will stop; ‘job done’. It is only through discussion and debate attitudes can change; far more effective over the long term, and on a broader scale, than a ban.
