 Almost impossible to achieve; images will just come from elsewhere
 A ban on airbrushing is very difficult to achieve. This is for two reasons; first it is difficult to detect, second it is easy to move elsewhere. Airbrushing is an attempt to make something that is fake appear real. In the majority of cases this makes it difficult to tell what is airbrushed and what is not as they are simply small changes. This in turn makes it difficult to enforce any ban; any real attempt to comprehensively do so would involve considerable manpower to sift through images.Second, if we ban in the media this likely will not be respected online. The government can only control images in its of country unless it wants to go down a route that involves considerable censorship. With more and more people consuming media online, children aged 12-15 spend 20 hours 48 minutes on the internet compared to 14 hours 24 minutes watching tv, exposure to airbrushed images is certain to remain. All the while there would become a disconnect between what the media is able to do, and what individuals can do with their own images, that are then ‘published’ through Instagram or other social networks.
