 Banning would help create a beneficial cultural shift
 A ban sends a signal about the need for change to a more open culture that is less misogynistic, less objectifying, and more equal. It will encourage positive behaviours; more realism, more body diversity, and healthier attitudes to the female body. With airbrushing banned the media will be forced to show a wider range which then gives a better idea of what is normal. This in turn will have beneficial effects reducing pressure to ‘be attractive’ even at the cost of health and increasing women’s self confidence something which would increase equality and ensure women are taken more seriously.
