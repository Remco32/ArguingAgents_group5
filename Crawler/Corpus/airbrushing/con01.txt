 Leads to eating disorders and other harmful effects
 Eating disorders are not just caused by perceived pressure from this societal norm. While this is one psychological factor there are also possible biological factors, nutritional deficiencies or genetics, or environmental factors such as high amounts of stress, trauma, as well as more obvious connections such as taking part in sports or professions that require the individual to be thin. As such it has so far difficult to link images of very thin models to anorexia.Moreover, it is wrong to claim that this norm is solely a result of photoshopping. Thin models existed long before airbrushing of images was introduced and will continue to be used after a ban. At the same time while there are studies linking people engaging in dieting to altered ultra thin images this is not the case with specific disorders such as anorexia.
