 Would give women the opportunity to speak out
 A ban would act as an enabler. When women see that they have been photoshopped in some way they would be able to speak out against the photographers and editors who have done this to them. In the status quo the media and their representatives have all the power; if the model wants the work they have to accept that they may be photoshopped to the media outlet’s preferences. They can’t speak out as they want to be employed again in future. However, if there is a ban on such images there will be far less pressure to conform, any women involved will be far more likely to speak out and report such alterations to their image.
