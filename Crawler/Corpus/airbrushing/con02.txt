 Would give women the opportunity to speak out
 Women have the opportunity to speak out in any case; any model that wishes could show the difference between what a magazine has shown of them and reality, and almost certainly get considerable publicity for it. A ban is not the best way to give women the opportunity to speak out or complain if that is the aim then ensuring thorough and impartial complaints systems which can tackle far more issues than just airbrushing would seem a more obvious solution.Â
