 Abortion is the killing of a human being, which defies the word of God.
  The does not draw a distinction between fetuses and babies: the Greek word brephos is used in the  to refer to both an unborn child and an infant.  By the time a baby is conceived, he or she is recognized by God, as demonstrated in Jeremiah 1:5: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee."  The Sixth Commandment of the  Old Testament, "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13), applies to all human beings, including unborn babies.  In the Hindu religion, the holy text states that abortion is an equivalent misdeed to killing one's own parents.  The BBC states that "Traditional Buddhism rejects abortion because it involves the deliberate destroying of a life."
