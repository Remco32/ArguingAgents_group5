 The US Supreme Court has declared abortion to be a "fundamental right" guaranteed by the US Constitution.
  The landmark abortion case , decided on Jan. 22, 1973 in favor of abortion rights, remains the law of the land. The 7-2 decision stated that the Constitution gives "a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy," and that "This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."
