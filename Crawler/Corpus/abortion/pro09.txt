 Reproductive choice protects women from financial disadvantage. 
 Many women who choose abortion don't have the financial resources to support a child. 42% of women having abortions are below the federal poverty level.  A survey in the peer-reviewed  asking women why they had an abortion found that 73% of respondents said they could not afford to have a baby, and 38% said giving birth would interfere with their education and career goals.  A University of Massachusetts at Amherst study published in the peer-reviewed  found that women at all income levels earn less when they have children, with low-wage workers being most affected, suffering a 15% earnings penalty.
