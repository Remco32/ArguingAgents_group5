 Abortions reduce the number of adoptable babies. 
 Instead of having the option to abort, women should give their unwanted babies to people who cannot conceive. The percentage of infants given up for adoption in the United States declined from 9% of those born before 1973 to 0.5% of those born in 2014.   As a result of the lack of women putting their children up for adoption, the number of US infant adoptions dropped from about 90,000 in 1971 to 18,329 in 2014.   Around 2.6 million Americans are seeking to adopt children.
