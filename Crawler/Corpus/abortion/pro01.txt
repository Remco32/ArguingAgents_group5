 Reproductive choice empowers women by giving them control over their own bodies. 
 The choice over when and whether to have children is central to a woman's independence and ability to determine her future.  Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the 1992 decision in , "The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives."  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion in  (2007) that undue restrictions on abortion infringe upon "a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature."  CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, JD, stated that  was "a landmark of what is, in the truest sense, women's liberation."
