 The decision in 
 US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stated that the right to privacy defended in  is "utterly idiotic" and should not be considered binding precedent: "There is no right to privacy [in the US Constitution]."   In his dissenting opinion in , Justice William H. Rehnquist stated that an abortion "is not 'private' in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the 'privacy' that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution..."  Furthermore, the 14th Amendment bars states from depriving "any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."  The Supreme Court overreached in  when it excluded unborn children from the class of "persons."
