 Fetuses are incapable of feeling pain when most abortions are performed. 
 According to a review by Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, "most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception." The cortex does not become functional until at least the 26th week of a fetus' development, long after most abortions are performed. This finding was endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,  which stated that that there is "no legitimate scientific information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain."  A University of California at San Francisco study said fetuses probably can't feel pain until the 29th or 30th week of gestation.  Abortions that late into a pregnancy are extremely rare and are often restricted by state laws.  According to Stuart W. G. Derbyshire, PhD, Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham (UK), "fetuses cannot be held to experience pain. Not only has the biological development not yet occurred to support pain experience, but the environment after birth, so necessary to the development of pain experience, is also yet to occur."  The "flinching" and other reactions seen in fetuses when they detect pain stimuli are mere reflexes, not an indication that the fetus is perceiving or "feeling" anything.
