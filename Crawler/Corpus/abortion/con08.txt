 Women should not be able to use abortion as a form of contraception. 
 It is immoral to kill an unborn child for convenience.  The Guttmacher Institute reported that 45% of all women having abortions every year have had at least one previous abortion,  while 8.6% of abortions reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014 were undergone by women who had three or more previous abortions.  This suggests that many women are using abortion as a contraceptive method.   co-author Steven Levitt, PhD, wrote that after abortion was legalized, "Conceptions rose by nearly 30 percent, but births actually fell by 6 percent, indicating that many women were using abortion as a method of birth control, a crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."
