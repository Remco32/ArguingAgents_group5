 Access to legal, professionally-performed abortions reduces maternal injury and death caused by unsafe, illegal abortions. 
 According to Daniel R. Mishell, Jr., MD, Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, before abortion was legalized women would frequently try to induce abortions by using coat hangers, knitting needles, or radiator flush, or by going to unsafe "back-alley" abortionists.  In 1972, there were 39 maternal deaths from illegal abortions. By 1976, after  had legalized abortion nationwide, this number dropped to two.  The World Health Organization estimated that unsafe abortions cause 68,000 maternal deaths worldwide each year, many of those in developing countries where safe and legal abortion services are difficult to access.
