 Abortion gives pregnant women the option to choose not to bring fetuses with profound abnormalities to full term. 
 Some fetuses have such severe disorders that death is guaranteed before or shortly after birth. These include anencephaly, in which the brain is missing, and limb-body wall complex, in which organs develop outside the body cavity.  It would be cruel to force women to carry fetuses with fatal congenital defects to term. Even in the case of nonfatal conditions, such as Down syndrome, parents may be unable to care for a severely disabled child. Deborah Anne Driscoll, MD, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, said "many couples... don't have the resources, don't have the emotional stamina, don't have the family support [to raise a child with Down syndrome]."
