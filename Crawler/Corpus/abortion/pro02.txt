 Personhood begins after a fetus becomes "viable" (able to survive outside the womb) or after birth, not at conception. 
   Embryos and fetuses are not independent, self-determining beings, and abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, not a baby. A person's age is calculated from birth date, not conception, and fetuses are not counted in the US Census. The majority opinion in  states that "the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment [of the US Constitution], does not include the unborn."
