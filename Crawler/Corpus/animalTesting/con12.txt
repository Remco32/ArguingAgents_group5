 Animals are very different from human beings and therefore make poor test subjects.
  The anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences between animals and people make animals poor models for human beings.  Paul Furlong, Professor of Clinical Neuroimaging at Aston University (UK), states that "it's very hard to create an animal model that even equates closely to what we're trying to achieve in the human."  Thomas Hartung, Professor of evidence-based toxicology at Johns Hopkins University, argues for alternatives to animal testing because "we are not 70 kg rats."
