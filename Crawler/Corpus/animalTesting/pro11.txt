 There is no adequate alternative to testing on a living, whole-body system. 
 Living systems like human beings and animals are extremely complex. Studying cell cultures in a petri dish, while sometimes useful, does not provide the opportunity to study interrelated processes occurring in the central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system.  Evaluating a drug for side effects requires a circulatory system to carry the medicine to different organs.  Also, conditions such as blindness and high blood pressure cannot be studied in tissue cultures.  Computer models can only be reliable if accurate information gleaned from animal research is used to build the models in the first place.  Furthermore, even the most powerful supercomputers are unable to accurately simulate the workings of complex organs such as the brain.
