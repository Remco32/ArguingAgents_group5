 Animals must be used in cases when ethical considerations prevent the use of human subjects.
  When testing medicines for potential toxicity, the lives of human volunteers should not be put in danger unnecessarily. It would be unethical to perform invasive experimental procedures on human beings before the methods have been tested on animals, and some experiments involve genetic manipulation that would be unacceptable to impose on human subjects before animal testing.  The World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki states that human trials should be preceded by tests on animals.
