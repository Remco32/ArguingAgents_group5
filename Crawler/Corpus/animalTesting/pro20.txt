 Some cosmetics and health care products must be tested on animals to ensure their safety.
  American women use an average of 12 personal care products per day, so product safety is of great importance.  The US Food and Drug Administration endorses the use of animal tests on cosmetics to "assure the safety of a product or ingredient."  China requires that all cosmetics be tested on animals before they go on sale, so cosmetics companies must have their products tested on animals if they want distribution in China.  Mosquito repellent, which helps protect people from malaria and other dangerous illnesses, must undergo toxicological testing (which involves animal testing) in order to be sold in the United States and Europe.
