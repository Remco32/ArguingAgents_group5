 Animals often make better research subjects than human beings because of their shorter life cycles.
  Laboratory mice, for example, live for only two to three years, so researchers can study the effects of treatments or genetic manipulation over a whole lifespan, or across several generations, which would be infeasible using human subjects.  Mice and rats are particularly well-suited to long-term cancer research, partly because of their short lifespans.
