 Religious traditions tell us to be merciful to animals, so we should not cause them suffering by experimenting on them.
  In the Bible, Proverbs 12:10 states: "A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast..."  The Hindu doctrine of ahimsa teaches the principle of not doing harm to other living beings.  The Buddhist doctrine of right livelihood dissuades Buddhists from doing any harm to animals.
