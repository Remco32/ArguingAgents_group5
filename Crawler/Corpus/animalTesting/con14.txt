 Animal tests may mislead researchers into ignoring potential cures and treatments.
  Some chemicals that are ineffective on, or harmful to, animals prove valuable when used by humans. Aspirin, for example, is dangerous for some animal species.  Intravenous vitamin C has shown to be effective in treating sepsis in humans, but makes no difference to mice.  Fk-506 (tacrolimus), used to lower the risk of organ transplant rejection, was "almost shelved" because of animal test results, according to neurologist Aysha Akhtar, MD, MPH.  A report on Slate.com stated that a "source of human suffering may be the dozens of promising drugs that get shelved when they cause problems in animals that may not be relevant for humans."
