 Animal tests are more expensive than alternative methods and are a waste of government research dollars.
  Humane Society International compared a variety of animal tests with their  counterparts and found animal tests were more expensive in every scenario studied.   Biotechnology company Empiriko invented synthetic livers which can predict the liver's metabolic reactions to drugs in a process that is quicker, cheaper, and more accurate than animal testing; in one trial it provided a level of specificity which previously would have required testing on 1,000 rats and 100 dogs.  According to Senator Jeff Flake's "Wastebook" of government funding, over $7.3 million of taxpayers' money was wasted on studies involving animals in 2016.  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) found $56.4 million of government funds spent on animal experiments that, despite running over many years, failed to provide any useful results.
