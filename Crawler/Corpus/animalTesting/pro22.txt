 Relatively few animals are used in research, which is a small price to pay for advancing medical progress.
  People in the United States eat 9 billion chickens and 150 million cattle, pigs and sheep annually, yet we only use around 26 million animals for research, 95% of which are rodents, birds and fish.  We eat more than 1,800 times the number of pigs than the number used in research, and we consume more than 340 chickens for every research animal.
