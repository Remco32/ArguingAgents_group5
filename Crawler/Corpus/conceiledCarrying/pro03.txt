 Most adults who carry concealed handguns are law-abiding and do not misuse their firearms.
  According to a 2000 report by engineering statistician William Sturdevant, in Texas the general public is 5.3 times more likely to be arrested for violent offenses and 14 times more likely to be arrested for non-violent offenses than concealed carry weapon permit holders.  An analysis of crime data by Nick Leghorn, blogger at "The Truth About Guns," found that concealed carry permit holders in North Carolina are five times less likely to kill someone than the general public, 5.48 times less likely to commit a violent crime with a firearm, and 6.6 times less likely to drive drunk.  The  reported that "the number of incidents in which concealed-gun carriers kill innocent people is a fraction of 1 percent of all gun-related homicides."
