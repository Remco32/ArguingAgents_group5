 The right to carry concealed handguns is guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.
  The entire Second Amendment states: "a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."  The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Dec. 11, 2012 case , ruled 2-1 that the Second Amendment's right to bear arms "must be interpreted to include a right to have a concealed gun in public, to have it ready for use, and to have it for self-defense."  The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in  by a 2-1 vote on Feb. 13, 2014 that the Second Amendment requires states to "permit some form of concealed carry for self-defense outside the home."
