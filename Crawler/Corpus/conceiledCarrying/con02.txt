 Second Amendment rights have limits.
  The entire Second Amendment states: "a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed." It does not mention concealed handguns.  US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the court's 5-4 majority opinion in : "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues."  In May 2014 the US Supreme Court declined to hear , a case challenging New Jersey's issuance of concealed weapons permits only to citizens who can prove a "justifiable need."
