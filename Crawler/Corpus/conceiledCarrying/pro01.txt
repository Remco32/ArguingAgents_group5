 Responsible citizens should have the right to arm themselves against criminals with guns.
  Violent criminals will always have guns. Rather than being victims, concealed handgun carriers have a sense of safety and security, especially when going outside at night or in dangerous areas. According to a 2001 study by the National Opinion Research Center, 59% of people who carry a gun outside the home do so because it makes them feel safer.  In Florida, the percentage of concealed handgun permit holders who are female rose from 15% in 2004 to 23% in 2014. One of these female permit holders stated that women "need to be able to defend their home and defend themselves if they go out. It's just a safety issue."  In addition, a study by criminologist Gary Kleck, PhD, concluded that "robbery and assault victims who used a gun to resist were less likely to be attacked or to suffer an injury than those who used any other methods of self-protection."  A peer-reviewed study published in the  found that when someone draws a concealed gun in self-defense, the criminal retreats 55.5% of the time.
