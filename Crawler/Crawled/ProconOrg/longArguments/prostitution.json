{"Pro argument": ["\"Amnesty International considers that to protect the rights of sex workers, it is necessary not only to repeal laws which criminalize the sale of sex, but also to repeal those which make the buying of sex from consenting adults or the organization of sex work (such as prohibitions on renting premises for sex work) a criminal offence...", "\n", "\nThe fact that various aspects of sex work are treated as criminal conduct in many countries means that sex workers cannot rely on support or protection from the police. For many sex workers, reporting crimes experienced during the course of their work means putting themselves at risk of criminalization and/or penalization on the basis of their involvement in sex work, seizure of their earnings, potential loss of their livelihood through related sanctions and/or monitoring by the police to detect their clients. As a result, sex workers are frequently unable to seek redress for crimes committed against them, thereby offering impunity to perpetrators. In addition, the stigmatized and criminalized status that sex workers experience gives law enforcement officials in many countries the scope to harass, extort and perpetrate physical and sexual violence against them, also with impunity. When they are not threatened with criminalization/penalization, sex workers are better able to collaborate with law enforcement to identify perpetrators of violence and abuse, including human trafficking.\""]},

{"Pro argument": ["\"It's time for legislators to wake up from slumber land by legalizing and regulating prostitution... ", "\n", "\nSome folks disapprove of the immoral nature of sex for sale and, perhaps, rightfully so. But judging morality is for churches, employers, family members and peers. It should not be a matter for law enforcement, court dockets and jail cells, costing the taxpayer dearly, every day, every month, every year...", "\n", "\nProstitution flourishes in the black market that would not exist if brothels and hookers were legitimized, licensed, medically inspected, zoned and taxed. Like drugs, gambling and other crimes of morality, or alcohol prohibition of years past, the black market is nourished by draconian laws that forever fail to accomplish its intended purpose...", "\n", "\nIn Germany, and other countries, prostitution is legal and taxed. They turn the 'crime' into an economic plus. In other countries like the United States, we create the 'crime,' which turns the behavior into an economic negative.

{"Pro argument": ["\"As civil libertarians, we believe the government should not throw consenting adults in jail for private sexual conduct. An adult who chooses to engage in sexual activity, whether for recreation, procreation or in exchange for something of value, makes a private, individual choice that should not be subject to criminal sanctions. Our rights to individual autonomy and privacy allow us all to make these decisions as adults.", "\n", "\nAs advocates for equality, we know that anti-sex work laws disproportionately target women along with LGBTQ people, young people and people of color, all of whom are overrepresented in the sex industry and at highest risk of arrest. Systemic discrimination can factor into the decision to participate in sex work. In the face of job discrimination, no viable alternatives for earning a living, ejection from school, eviction from housing or ostracism from your family for your gender identity or sexual orientation, sex work may offer one of the more stabilizing and accessible ways to support yourself and your family. As criminal justice reformers, we see laws criminalizing sex work as another way of misdirecting law enforcement resources and expanding our unjust system of mass incarceration. Scarce tax dollars underwrite people's arrests and imprisonment for consensual activity. In addition to criminal records, arrests for sex work come with devastating collateral consequences, including eviction, loss of child custody and deportation.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"Contrary to stereotypes of paid sex, work in a legal brothel is not especially dangerous or hazardous to one's health. Some sex workers view their profession as involving greater skill and even a more human touch than alternative jobs open to them.

That is what most sex workers want as well...", "\n", "\n[C]ountries that criminalize the sex industry should consider the harms these laws cause, as Amnesty International has done.

{"Pro argument": ["\"The ACLU supports the decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of prostitution. The ACLU also condemns the abuse of vagrancy or loitering laws or licensing or regulatory schemes to harass and arrest those who may be engaged in solicitation for prostitution. While there are both male and female prostitutes, laws against prostitution most frequently refer to, or are applied to woman. Despite the statutory stress on female prostitution, the ACLU's policy is applicable to prostitutes of both sexes... ", "\n", "\nSuch laws have traditionally represented one of the most direct forms of discrimination against women. The woman who engage in prostitution is punished criminally and stigmatized socially while her male customer, either by the explicit design of the statute or through a pattern of discriminatory enforcement is left unscathed.", "\n", "\nProstitution laws are also a violation of the right of individual privacy because they impose penal sanctions for the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. Whether a person chooses to engage in sexual activity for purposes of recreation, or in exchange for something of value, is a matter of individual choice, not for governmental interference. Police use of entrapment techniques to enforce laws against this essentially private activity is reprehensible. Similarly, the use of loitering and vagrancy laws to punish prostitutes for their status or to make arrests on the basis of reputation and appearance, is contrary to civilized notions of due process of law. ", "\n", "\nSince the ACLU policy is that prostitution should not be made criminal, solicitation for prostitution is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.", "\n", "\nThe ACLU reaffirms its policy favoring removal of criminal penalties for prostitution and in support of total sexual freedom among consenting adults in private.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"It is [for] some time that I have been pointing out that the introduction of an ad-hoc regulation for prostitution in Italy is most urgent for a number of reasons: fight against organized crime, rehabilitation of certain areas of our towns and for health-related conditions. In reorganizing prostitution we could follow the examples set by such towns as Amsterdam and Berlin, where prostitution is restricted to specific areas or to specific places which are regularly controlled by health and tax inspectors. The means to enforce a regulation for prostitution may vary but the end is only one: take prostitutes away from the street and from the criminal gangs and keep an activity which is presently more or less underground under tax and health controls.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"To end abuses in the sex industry, the Netherlands decided to change the law to reflect everyday reality. It is now legal to employ prostitutes who are over the age of consent, and do the work voluntarily, but stricter measures have been introduced under criminal law to prevent exploitation.

The police conduct frequent controls of brothels and are thus in a position to pick up signs of human trafficking. This approach is in the interests of prostitutes themselves, and it facilitates action against sexual violence and abuse and human trafficking...", "\n", "\nAn important spin-off of the policy is that it prevents human trafficking, which is characterised by exploitation, coercion and violence. The lifting of the ban on brothels makes prostitution a legitimate occupation and gives prostitutes the same rights and protection as other professionals.", "\n", "\nThe labour laws offer the most effective protection against exploitation, violence and coercion. The policy is based on the conviction that strengthening the position of women is the best way to combat sexual violence. Moreover, abuses are easier to detect when prostitutes operate publicly and legally rather than in a clandestine subculture.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"We were very determined but didn't think we'd actually achieve getting the law changed. It was a long battle over 15 years to get those draconian measures off our statutes books.

Sex workers provide a service which is needed and wanted by many...", "\n", "\nI cannot accept that in this day and age our nation should continue to make criminals of sex workers because the Bible says it is wrong.

Secondly, the only prostitutes directly condemned in the Bible were those who used sex as a method of worship, which is not something commonly practised in this country.", "\n", "\nThe Bible takes a much stronger stand against adultery than against common whoredom, but I doubt that even the more conservative among us would wish to see adulterers cooling their heels in Auckland Central police station...", "\n", "\nAnd I don't lack a conscience because I believe we would all be better off in a society which had the honesty to accept the job choice that some adults make as valid and worthy of care and compassion, for all our sakes.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"The assumption underlying much of the bad press Germany has received is that decriminalization is a boon to the underworld. In fact, the opposite is closer to the truth. Prostitution is like any other industry. Make it illegal, and you give criminals a monopoly. Legalize it, and you give law-abiding enterprises a chance to compete... ", "\n", "\nMoreover, regulated brothels now are operated as legitimate businesses, and so attract professional managers -- as opposed to underworld thugs...", "\n", "\nFor all concerned, the best course of action is to bring this business under the ambit of the law.

{"Pro argument": ["\"Nothing's changed since Ipswich. Five women can be murdered and nothing will be done. A hundred sex workers have been killed in the last 10 years. Sex workers face rape, violence, and murder every day they're out there. It's a fact of the system and the Government knows this. ", "\n", "\nBut sex work doesn't fit the Government's ideas of morality. It starts from a position that all prostitution is violence against women. The police say they won't accept street prostitution, so the women are all criminals... Where prostitution is legal, in Utrecht and Cologne, there have never been any murders.", "\n", "\nThe sale of sexual services per se is not all that different from selling other services. I don't think that sexual labour under the right conditions, as opposed to mental labour or physical labour, is about violation. Loads of sex workers have done professional jobs. A lot have been nurses. They say they did far more dehumanising things as nurses than in sex work. And they now have control over the hours they work.", "\n", "\nStreet prostitution is never going to be eradicated. Enabling women to do it safely is what policy should be about... There is an argument that regulation increases prostitution, but how do they know? If local authorities gave brothels licences they would have the ability to control it.

{"Pro argument": ["\"The evidence from Nevada suggests that decriminalization, in tandem with legal regulatory schemes, would better protect the health and safety of both prostitutes and their customers.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"The Swedish situation is that they banned sex for sale, which we don't think is feasible. It drives it underground, and when it's driven underground, criminality, the trafficking of women, and drugs are under much less scrutiny by the police, because they just don't have the intelligence about what's going on if the women are hidden...

{"Pro argument": ["\"In order to use labor laws to protect women in the sex industry, the legal status of prostitution and its offshoots--brothel keeping, pimping, soliciting, paying for sex--would need to be re-examined. After all, the Department of Justice does not ensure minimum wages for drug runners or concern itself with working conditions in the Mob. ", "\n", "\nBut whether or not we approve of sex work or would want our daughters to be thus employed, the moral argument for condemnation starts to fall apart when we consider the conditions of abuse suffered by real women working in the industry. Criminalization has been as unsuccessful in dismantling the sex industry as it has been in eliminating the drug trade and preventing back-alley abortions.", "\n", "\nSex work is here to stay, and by recognizing it as paid labor governments can guarantee fair treatment as well as safe and healthy work environments--including overtime and vacation pay, control over condom use, and the right to collective bargaining.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"There's such a stigma about the money!... Well, that's the big taboo: sleeping with men for money. It's perfectly legal--in this state anyway--for a woman to have sex with anyone she chooses, at any time. But the minute five cents changes hands--then boom! She's a whore, and she goes to jail. It's ludicrous.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"I think the laws on prostitution are archaic. Especially in regards to pornography -- if a camera's there, it's okay. I think if the U.S. decriminalized and regulated it, then everyone would benefit. By making it illegal, this is where murders, and drugs, and nefarious activity comes in. That's why the women always suffer...\""]},

", "\n", "\nEvery time a prostitute is arrested, two more take her place. There's a bottomless market for their services. I'm sure some cops, lawyers and judges sometimes enter this market, but they can never admit it because it would undercut their authority to arrest, prosecute and punish those who gave them release the day before.", "\n", "\nWhether one pays to participate in an orgy or to hire the services of a prostitute, I see no reason to bring in the heavy guns of the criminal law. When it comes to sex, I see only one legal rule of any real importance: for sex to be lawful there only needs to be consent, and it should not matter whether consent is secured by direct payment or weeks of expensive courtship with fine dining and false promises.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"The practice of prostitution has been technically licensed by the [Phoenix] police for a period of many years. The women from the 'redlight' district are arraigned before the Magistrates Court once a month and invariably plead guilty. Those charged with being inmates of a house of prostitution pay a fine of $25, those charged with operating a house of prostitution pay $50. The city derives a revenue from this source of approximately $20,000 a year... ", "\n", "\nThe advantages of the existing system are: that practically all prostitutes are known to the police and can be kept under supervision; the city derives a substantial revenue, and prostitution is kept out of the residential districts...

", "\n", "\nI AM CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION, UNDER RIGID POLICE AND HEALTH SUPERVISION.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"The analysis seems to support the hypothesis that the rape rate could be lowered if prostitution was more readily available. This would be accomplished in most countries by its legalization. In the United States where prostitution is illegal, the low-end price for most prostitutes is about $200 and the monthly per capita income is $2,820. In Amsterdam, Netherlands where prostitution is legal the price is $30. If prostitution were legalized in the United States it is rational to assume that prices would resemble those in the Netherlands, this would result in...a decrease in the rape rate of 10 per 100,000. The population of the United States if roughly 275 million so this should result is a decrease of approximately 25,000 rapes per year.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"The sociological and psychological data supporting the legal and policy justifications for the decriminalization or legalization of prostitution reveal that the costs of criminal prohibition outweigh the benefits. The evidence concerning the negative impacts of the present criminal status of prostitution supports the conclusion of the San Francisco Committee on Crime that 'we can do little worse by trying something different.' The evidence concerning the positive effects of decriminalization suggests that we can do a great deal better.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"Prostitution should not be a crime. Prostitutes are not committing an inherently harmful act. While the spread of disease and other detriments are possible in the practice of prostitution, criminalization is a sure way of exacerbating rather than addressing such effects. We saw this quite clearly in the time of alcohol prohibition in this country... ", "\n", "\nI would like the government to decriminalize prostitution but to regulate it in the way that other intimate service professions (such as massage therapists and doctors) are regulated on the basis of hygiene-related concerns. ", "\n", "\nOne thing I would add is that there is a double-standard that permeates the enforcement of laws against prostitution. The prostitutes are harassed, arrested, and sometimes prosecuted, while the johns (and often the pimps, who are far more likely to be engaged in violent and master/slave-like treatment of the prostitutes) are ignored. This reflects the view that men who traffic in women are not as bad as the women in whom they traffic. If people are honestly concerned about the wellbeing of women in this profession, then they must begin by removing the status of 'outlaw' from these women so that they can come forward and receive help if and when they feel they want to leave a profession that can otherwise be quite difficult to escape.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"Feminists like to quote these absolutely specious statistics, a typical trick of the feminist movement of the last twenty years. For example, they'll say the majority of prostitutes have been sexually abused as children. But there's no evidence for this! The most successful prostitutes are invisible, because the sign of a prostitute's success is her absolute blending with the environment. She's so shrewd, she never becomes visible. She never gets in trouble. She has command of her life, and her clients. The ones who get into the surveys have drug problems or psychological problems. They're the ones who were sexually abused. Feminists are using amateurs to condemn a whole profession. This is appalling! ", "\n", "\nI'm against the harassment of prostitutes. Unless they are actually interfering with people's movements, they have a perfect right to be doing what they're doing.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"I am not making a moral judgment here. I see prostitution as a reality of the modern world. The chances of eliminating it are practically nil. Under those circumstances it is better to keep it in check and under control by giving it a legal framework. This is not to say that I approve of brothels - but it seems to me that it would be better to have prostitution take place there - with medical check-ups and prostitutes paying taxes. It would be the lesser of two evils.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"I entertained and had sex with all kinds of men, from the rich and famous, to Hasidic Jewish businessmen, from Mafia gangsters, to police officers. Naturally I had quite a few clients who worked as judges and lawyers. The men of the legal profession were generally respectful, good tippers (often we made about the same hourly wage), and always in a hurry to get back to work. They came to me racked with stress and tension, and left feeling relaxed and blissful. I could take pride in my work. I'm convinced that without prostitution, the legal system could not function... ", "\n", "\nI continued to do prostitution for twenty years. I've always been involved in the grass roots movement to decriminalize prostitution--the political cause which is most near and dear to my heart. We've made some baby steps. It's really about time that someone, somehow, challenge the prostitution laws and get them thrown in the garbage where they belong. It is absurd and mean spirited to make consensual sex a crime.\""]},
{"Pro argument": ["\"I am a 'john.' I make no apology. In any rational universe the fact that I am able to have a sexual experience with a consenting adult only if I pay that adult would be nobody's business but mine. Tragically, this is not the case. I am guilty of a crime and subject to arrest. So are those sex workers who tend to my needs.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"The existence of prostitution anywhere is society's betrayal of women, especially those who are marginalized and vulnerable because of their sex, their ethnicity, their poverty, and their history of abuse and neglect. Prostitution is sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, often torture. Women in prostitution face a statistical probability of weekly rape, like domestic violence taken to the extreme.", "\n", "\nThe complicity of governments sustains prostitution. When the sex trade expands, women are less likely to compete with men for jobs. When prostitution is incorporated into states' economies, governments are relieved of the necessity of finding employment for women. Blood taxes are collected by the state-as-pimp in legal and decriminalized prostitution. Banks, airlines, Internet providers, hotels, travel agencies, and all media are integral to the exploitation and abuse of women in prostitution tourism, make huge profits, and are solidified as part of the economy.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"Prostitution is not a fairy tale. 'Pretty Woman' normalizes something that destroys lives. It glamorizes prostitution and creates an illusion that prostitution is a voluntary, desirable occupation.

We need men and women to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves.

{"Con argument": ["\"As far as legislation towards decriminalising the sale of sex is concerned, I hold the same views today that I held all through the 1990s when I was a working prostitute myself, and that view is no, I do not support that, because to support decriminalising the sale of sex would be to support prostitution itself\u2026", "\n", "\nI believe if a prostitute or former prostitute wants to see prostitution legalised, it is because she is inured [desensitized] both to the wrong of it and to her own personal injury from it...", "\n", "\nTo be prostituted is humiliating enough; to legalise prostitution is to condone that humiliation, and to absolve those who inflict it.

{"Con argument": ["\"I ask you to think about your own bodies--if you can do so outside the world that the pornographers have created in your minds, the flat, dead, floating mouths and vaginas and anuses of women. I ask you to think concretely about your own bodies used that way. How sexy is it? Is it fun? The people who defend prostitution and pornography want you to feel a kinky little thrill every time you think of something being stuck in a woman. I want you to feel the delicate tissues in her body that are being misused. I want you to feel what it feels like when it happens over and over and over and over and over and over and over again: because that is what prostitution is...

I am talking to you about prostitution per se, without more violence, without extra violence, without a woman being hit, without a woman being pushed. Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. And if you are not simple-minded, you will never understand it. The more complex you manage to be, the further away from the reality you will be--the safer you will be, the happier you will be, the more fun you will have discussing the issue of prostitution. In prostitution, no woman stays whole.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"Behind the facade of a regulated industry, brothel prostitutes in Nevada are captive in conditions analogous to slavery. Women often are procured for the brothels from other areas by pimps who dump them at the house in order to collect the referral fee. Women report working in shifts commonly as long as 12 hours, even when ill, menstruating or pregnant, with no right to refuse a customer who has requested them or to refuse the sexual act for which he has paid. The dozen or so prostitutes I interviewed said they are expected to pay the brothel room and board and a percentage of their earnings -- sometimes up to 50 percent. They also must pay for mandatory extras such as medical exams, assigned clothing and fines incurred for breaking house rules. And, contrary to the common claim that the brothel will protect women from the dangerous, crazy clients on the streets, rapes and assaults by customers are covered up by the management.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"In Sweden, prostitution is officially acknowledged as a form of male sexual violence against women and children. One of the cornerstones of Swedish policies against prostitution and trafficking in human beings is the focus on the root cause, the recognition that without men's demand for and use of women and girls for sexual exploitation, the global prostitution industry would not be able flourish and expand. ", "\n", "\nProstitution is a serious problem that is harmful, in particular, not only to the prostituted woman or child but also to society at large. Therefore, prostituted women and children are seen as victims of male violence who do not risk legal penalties. Instead, they have a right to assistance to escape prostitution.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"Historians will also note the attacks on the Bush administration and [Ambassador John R.] Miller from a shrill claque of academic feminists and their radical chic allies -- and by doing so these historians will understand the reasons for the declining state of the 21st-century American left. They will see in the critics' attacks liberal utopianism at its worst -- the belief that until all poverty and all exploitation of the weak has ended, targeted efforts 'merely' to ameliorate such 'symptoms' as the mafia-conducted destruction of millions of girls and women in the sex trade are distractions from the need to eliminate 'root causes.' Historians will see in these attacks rhetoric and ideology unhinged from reality, a worship of materialist goals, contempt for traditional values, and a moral stinginess that denies credit for good work to any but political allies...

{"Con argument": ["\"A few years ago, prostitutes disappeared from the pages of medical journals; they returned as 'sex workers.' Nor did they work in prostitution any more: they were employees in the 'sex industry.' Presumably, orgasms are now a consumer product just like any other. As for pimps, the correct term is probably: 'brief sexual liaison coordinators.' ", "\n", "\nThe editors who decided on the new terminology almost certainly felt, and probably still do feel, a warm glow of self-satisfaction (one of the few emotions than never lets you down). How they must have prided themselves on their broadmindedness, as they strove to reduce the small-minded stigma traditionally attached to offering sexual services in return for money! How morally brave and daring they must have felt, to fly so boldly in the face of two millennia of unthinking condemnation!... ", "\n", "\nThe idea of the state coercing its population into prostitution is, of course, repellent. Even the most liberal of liberals would probably agree with that.

{"Con argument": ["\"I believe that two crimes make a city look totally out of control. That's open prostitution and open air drug trafficking. I was appalled at the blatant prostitution taking place in the District and I have been determined to put an end to it. You're right that often times a problem is simply displaced when strong enforcement action is taken, that's to be expected, actually. The key is to shift resources to the new location and continue to take strong enforcement action wherever the problem crops up. Eventually, people engaged in this kind of activity either stop or leave the area altogether.\""]},
{"Con argument": ["\"Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected. If we assume that he or she takes only 4 weeks to become positive, because there is an additional lag time of 1-2 weeks to get the results back, there will be at best a window period of 6 weeks for a prostitute. The average prostitute services between 10-15 clients per day. This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution.\""]},
