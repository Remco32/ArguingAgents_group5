{"Pro argument": "Boys and girls develop at different times and speeds, therefore they should be taught separately", "Counterpoint": ["Everyone develops at slightly different speeds, however few would advocate everyone should be home-schooled. Ultimately, the curriculum determines the mode of teaching, not the gender composition of the class, and the curriculum can be moulded to suit both girls and boys, faster and slower learners and those with under-developed hand-motor control. If elementary school boys are being forced to repeat grades that is a manifestation of difficulties in learning and as relevant to their proximity to girls in the classroom as it is to the higher-achieving boys. Furthermore, the sociologist Cynthia Epstein argues that in fact \u2018there is no consensus among psychologists as to the existence of psychological or cognitive differences between the sexes\u2019.", "[1]", "\u00a0Finally, as Michael Bronski notes, the benefits of same-sex schools cannot be applied across the educational sphere for the private schools where the tests take place admit \u2018either only high-achieving pupils or self-select by expelling poorly-performing or misbehaving students\u2019.", "[2]", "\n", "[1]", "\u00a0", "Kaimer, W. \u2018The Trouble with Single-sex Schools\u2019.

{"Counterpoint": ["Children will gain exposure to the opposite sex when they reach adult life; whilst they are young, they should be around those who they feel most comfortable with. The inclinations of children in the formative years, between 7 and 15, are to gravitate towards their own sex. What is natural should be encouraged, and can most easily be done so in single-sex institutions. Furthermore, they naturally tend towards behaviour appropriate to their gender. It is therefore easier to implement an education strategy geared specifically towards one gender. Moreover, certain subjects are best taught, both in terms of ease and effectiveness, in single-sex classrooms, such as sex education or gender issues.", "\n"], "Con argument": "Children need to be exposed to the opposite sex in preparation for later life", "Point": ["The formative years of children are the best time to expose them to the company of the other gender, in order that they may learn each other\u2019s\u2019 behaviour and be better prepared for adult life. Moreover, the school's role is to prepare its students for life which involves interaction between the sexes, by preventing inter-sexual interaction we hurt the role of the school significantly. The effects of same-sex schools are significant. This creates segregation men and women, this which as a result of a lack of contact between them can create fear and uneasiness between them. This might be compatred to segregation between black and white in the USA or South Africa where the resulting racism and troubles to bond has yet to heal. We already live in a society where women are discriminated against, segregation cannot be the answer to this. Furthermore, the number of subjects benefiting from single-sex discussion is so small that this could easily be organised within a co-educational system. Furthermore, even if girls naturally perform better in an environment without boys, they need to learn how to perform just as well with boys. Dr. Alan Smithers, a respected British schools expert, declared in a 2006 report that \u2018distraction by boys was a myth\u2019 and that \u2018half a century of research has not shown any dramatic or consistent advantages for single-sex education for boys or girls\u2019.", "[1]", "\n", "[1]", "\u00a0", "Asthana, A. \u2018Single-sex schools \u2018no benefit to girls\u2019\u2019.

{"Counterpoint": ["Single-sex schools for women are a natural extension of the feminist movement; there are co-educational schools, men have had their own schools, why should women not? It would still be discrimination if there were only male single-sex schools; as long as both genders are catered for, this discrimination is redressed. The issue in states like India is not there are too many single-sex schools, but that there are not enough. This is more to do with cultural preferences for males, and a population heavily overpopulated with males, than the lingering effects of British colonial rule.", "\n"], "Con argument": "Single-sex schools are manifestations of patriarchal societies", "Point": ["Single-sex schools are a throwback to the patriarchal society of the past; in many historical cultures, only men were allowed an education of any sort. To perpetuate this is to remind women of their past subservience and to continue to hold them from full social inclusion. In India, where the colonial yoke of British rule remains, the national average for the difference in male-female literacy is 16.7%, with some districts as high as 28%.", "[1]", "\u00a0Single-sex schools discourage female education and make it increasingly difficult for parents to find room for girls in the limited co-educational schools.
