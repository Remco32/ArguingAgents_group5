University life is not used as the previous argument would suggest. University life is often about alcohol first, education second. Self\u00adknowledge and genuine wisdom come from study and reflection. This can be done anywhere, not just in a university. There is no fundamental right of individuals to be allowed to take four years free of charge to learn new skills that will benefit them or teach them how to be better citizens.

{"Pro argument": "The state benefits from the skills of a university educated populace ", "Counterpoint": ["Countries need educated people, including a certain amount of university graduates, but the idea proposed, that everyone having a degree would benefit society economically, is unfounded. There is no economic benefit when people with degrees are doing jobs that do not require university education, and represents a substantial misallocation of resources on the part of the state.4\u00a0As to developing future leaders, those who are gifted or particularly driven can still rise to the top, even if university is not free, as scholarships tend to be mostly aimed at such individuals.\u00a0", "\n"], "Point": ["A university educated society is of great value to any state, and provides three main benefits. Firstly, it provides extensive economic benefits. There is a profound advantage to countries that actively promote a culture of \u201csmart economy\u201d3, with a highly educated and technically able workforce. They are more likely to be innovative and highly productive. Secondly, higher education leads to an increase in cultural awareness via subjects like the arts, history, and the classics. The third benefit is the development of leaders in society. The barrier created by university fees will prevent some potentially high\u00ad worth individuals from ever reaching their potential. \u00a0", "\n"]},

", "Counterpoint": ["There is no fundamental right to a university education; it is a service, and people should pay for it, not freeload on the taxpayer. Rights exist to provide people with the necessities of life. Some people may never have the \u201copportunity\u201d, ie. wealth, to visit Hawai\u2019i, yet that is not unfair and the state should not be expected to fund every citizen\u2019s tropical vacation.

In this way the state can provide equality of opportunity while the wealthier pay.\u00a0", "\n"], "Point": ["The employment prospects created by a university degree are substantial, and many lines of work are only available to university graduates. True merit should define the ability to attend university, not the accident of birth. With the institution of fees, access becomes more difficult, and will certainly lead to lower attendance by poorer groups. This serves to lock people into the economic situation when they are born, as getting out is much more difficult when denied access to most high\u00adincome jobs.5", "\n", "5\u00a0Tribune Opinion. 2005. \u201cEducation Paves Way Out of Poverty\u201d.\u00a0", "Greeley Tribune", "\u200b .

If people are willing to take loans it shows they consider the education worth the cost. It can actually be quite beneficial to society at large that university graduates seek swift employment due to debt, since it forces them to become productive members of society more rapidly than they might have done. For example, in Ireland where higher education is free graduates often take a year or two to travel and \u201cfind themselves\u201d while giving little or nothing back to the state that has financed their degrees. It is good that people begin contributing to the economic life of society after graduating from university, rather than frittering away their youths in unproductive pursuits.", "\n"], "Point": ["University fees are usually quite high.

It seems fair that all states should offer access to their citizens to primary and secondary education opportunities. University, on the other hand, is not essential to life in the same way.

It is a fair trade between inefficiencies created by inattentive students and diligent students who would have lacked the facility to attend without it being free.
